		<br>Revolution Went Blending into Commerce: <i>Vineland</i> and Co-option in a Total Society</h3><br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The lineage between <i>Vineland</i> and <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> is clear. Not only do its places and characters make cameos, but the earlier novel’s problematic values return in the form of a vaguely remembered utopianism: back in the sixties, Frenesi ‘dreamed of a mysterious people’s oneness’ in which ‘individuals’ would ‘transcend […] unexpectedly’ (<i>VL</i> 117-118). Michael O’Bryan points out that not only does the ‘chronological layering’ create a ‘typically Pynchonian formal complexity,’ but it also ‘clearly invites comparison’ between ‘the radical heyday of the swinging sixties and the radical nadir of the Reagan eighties’.<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> The year 1984 is a precise choice: not only does it clearly evoke Orwell’s novel, to which Pynchon would later contribute an introduction,<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> but to Sean Carswell ‘signifies the heart of the neoliberal takeover’.<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> Carswell points out that not only was 1984 ‘the year of Ronald Reagan’s reelection’,<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> but that the year ‘represents a time of both increased law enforcement funding and the acceleration of paramilitary forces fighting in the so-called War on Drugs’.<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> On a wider scale, David Harvey documents in <i>A Brief History of Neoliberalism</i> that ‘[i]n 1984 the World Bank, for the first time in its history, granted a loan to a country in return for structural neoliberal reforms’.<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> Despite this clearly political narrative framework, critics have disagreed about the novel’s political alignment: Geoffrey Green identifies the difficulty in asking ‘are the political ideas expressed in the novel [Pynchon’s]? Are they ours? Or are they merely a parodied representation of political viewpoints?’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> I would argue that when compared with <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, <i>Vineland</i> documents a very different political atmosphere of hopelessness, inaction, and complicity. Rather than providing a practical political alternative Pynchon, in this novel, demonstrates what the politics of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> led to, exploring the possibility of radical political action and the state of American society at the end of the 20th century. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Postmodernist Fiction</i>, Brian McHale situates <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> within ‘modernism and its epistemological premises’,<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small>&nbsp;Oedipa functioning as ‘an exemplary late-modernist heroine’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> looking forward towards the ‘possibilities of the plurality of worlds’.<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> By 1990 and the publication of <i>Vineland</i>, however, that moment of plurality had purportedly arrived as the epoch of postmodernism. Yet while, as Fredric Jameson writes, modernism ‘thought compulsively about the new and tried to watch its coming into being’,<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> the years of postmodernism are instead ‘marked by an inverted millenarianism’.<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> It is Jameson’s <i>Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</i> that most significantly delineated the theoretical atmosphere that Pynchon documents: Ian Buchanan notes that Jameson’s theory of the postmodern ‘functioned as the essential conceptual anchor’ for ‘critical discussions in both academic and non-academic circles’ about the contemporary moment.<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> One of Jameson’s key tenets is the loss of ‘the possibility of the positioning of the cultural act outside the massive Being of capital’,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> and Pynchon’s novel converges with Jameson’s description of an ensuing situation in which ‘forms of cultural resistance’ and even ‘overtly political interventions are all somehow secretly disarmed and reabsorbed by a system […] they can achieve no distance from’.<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small>&nbsp;It’s such a situation that informs Brook’s argument that Prairie is unable to find a counterculture to ascribe to when ‘in a postmodern culture, one denies any official, authorized culture’.<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Brooks reads Prairie’s boyfriend Isaiah’s ‘band, whose music is an often cacophonous pastiche of various styles’ as ‘incomprehensible’ and therefore ‘ludicrous’.<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> I would soften Brooks’ condemnation here by pointing out that Isaiah is clearly demarcated as belonging to a generation which comprehends television: he perceptively tells Zoyd that the older generation ‘didn’t understand much about the Tube’ (<i>VL</i> 373), and Isaiah’s music can therefore be argued to consciously speak in a newly comprehensible language of ‘TV and its iconic mosaic image’, to borrow the phrasing of sixties media prophet Marshall McLuhan.<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> Jameson’s lament for capitalism’s incorporation of counterculture is echoed elsewhere, however, by a moment of cultural assessment from Prairie. Described as ‘[a]mong the first mall rats’ (<i>VL</i> 325), Prairie hitchhikes to ‘folkloric’ (<i>VL</i> 325) malls, resenting their ‘yuppification’ (<i>VL</i> 326) in comparison to the malls she had ‘grown up with’ (<i>VL</i> 326): Prairie’s cultural options are circumscribed both metaphorically and literally within the marketplace. At a perhaps more menacing level, the opening act of the novel is one of impotence. Planning his annual ‘something publicly crazy’ in order to continue receiving ‘mental-disability […] benefits’, Zoyd finds he’s ‘been rescheduled’ (<i>VL</i> 3) and ends up jumping through ‘stunt windows made of clear sheet candy’ (<i>VL</i> 12) whilst surrounded by ‘six mobile TV units’ (<i>VL</i> 8). Hayles identifies the act as symbolising that ‘[t]he only craziness happening now is that approved, or rather <i>demanded</i>, by the authorized codes’,<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> in this case dictated by the television industry. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of prescribed transgression that opens <i>Vineland</i> also points to the novel’s key motif of inactivity, television, and ‘the ever-dwindling attention span of an ever more infantilized population’ (<i>VL</i> 52). One of the novel’s more fantastical events is the reappearance of murdered activist Weed Atman as a Thanatoid. The term, which we are told means ‘like death, only different’ (<i>VL </i>170), is applied to a community of ‘ghosts’ (<i>VL</i> 173) in a kind of purgatory, ‘in transition’ after ‘mediated deaths’ (<i>VL</i> 218), ‘slow-talking’ (<i>VL</i> 226) and ‘slow […] moving’ (<i>VL</i> 225). The other feature which defines the Thanatoids is that they ‘watch a lot of Tube’ (<i>VL</i> 170), in fact spending ‘at least part of every waking hour with an eye on the Tube’ (<i>VL</i> 170-171). Although he doesn’t make the connection himself, the Thanatoids satirically embody Stephen doCarmo’s exposition of Jameson’s ‘ultimately optimistic view’ that ‘the Marxist Left is not dead, but only slumbering through some weird dream, waiting to reawaken wiser and stronger’.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> David Thoreen argues that ‘Zoyd Wheeler and the contemporary American voter have slept through a change in governments […] from democracy to fascism’,<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> and Carswell describes <i>Vineland</i>’s society as ‘hypnotized by television’.<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small>&nbsp;Both critics emphasise television as distracting, yet the novel also implies that television can actively manipulate. Hector Zuñiga witnesses a sudden and enigmatic broadcast of an army officer ‘sitting at a desk’ (<i>VL </i>339) and beginning to read a National Security Decision Directive before regular programming suddenly resumes ‘with no further military interruptions’ (<i>VL </i>340), and fears that the television will suddenly ‘stop showing pictures and instead announce, “From now on, I’m watching you”’ (<i>VL</i> 340). DoCarmo equates the ‘media images’ of <i>Vineland</i> with Guy Debord,<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> evoking Debord’s description of spectacle as exposing and manifesting ‘the impoverishment, enslavement and negation of real life’.<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> DoCarmo uses the quotation merely as evidence that Debord disapproves of the spectacle: ‘Like Guy Debord’, doCarmo writes, ‘Pynchon longs, on one level, to see a population hypnotised by ideologically-loaded media reawakened to struggle’.<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> More significantly, Debord pertinently signals the way in which the spectacle contributes to an impoverishment of real life, the way in which media shapes reality.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reality of <i>Vineland</i> is not only about television but is formally infused with it. As John Callens points out, for Prairie, the television image is ‘both otherworldly and fatuous, and it renders human reality to a proportionate degree painfully inadequate’.<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> Not only is reality impoverished in the eyes of the characters, but reality is moulded into an insincere televisual framework: Tobias Meinel documents a proliferation of ‘references to movies, television hosts and characters, game shows, and sitcoms’,<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small>&nbsp;the novel’s form itself ‘reminiscent of TV’s editing style’ with its quick cuts, sitcom-style switches between different focal characters, and even asides echoing commercial breaks.<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> To return to Jameson, ‘postmodern hyperspace’ has transcended ‘the capacities of the individual human body to locate itself […] to map the great global multinational and decentered communicational network in which we find ourselves caught’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small>; <i>Vineland</i> portrays a culture in which individual cognitive mapping is replaced by a mediated televisual reality used as a framework to comprehend the real world. Characters pray for the arrival of ‘Superman’ or ‘Tarzan on that vine’ (<i>VL</i> 116); characters looking around are described as ‘checking the edges of the frame’ (<i>VL</i> 171). Yet where does this leave the possibility of radical politics? Frenesi, as she becomes involved with federal prosecutor Brock Vond and betrays her radical film collective 24fps by framing People’s Republic of Rock and Roll (PR3) leader Weed Atman, becomes mediated from her own actions: she’s described as ‘walking around next to herself, attending a movie of it all’, feeling ‘safe in a world-next-to-the-world […] where she could kick back and watch the unfolding drama’ (<i>VL</i> 237). Slavoj Žižek’s concept of ‘interpassivity’ is useful here, in which (using the example of a television show) ‘it is the object itself which “enjoys the show” instead of me, relieving me of the superego duty to enjoy myself’.<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> For Žižek, recording movies with a VCR in the place of actually watching them gives a ‘profound satisfaction’, enabling one ‘simply to relax and indulge in the exquisite art of <i>far niente</i> [idleness] – as if the VCR is in a way <i>watching them for me, in my place</i>’.<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> Elsewhere, Žižek describes the ‘exteriorization’ of ‘canned laughter’ in which ‘the Other – embodied in the television set – is relieving us even of our duty to laugh’ allowing us to do ‘nothing but gaze drowsily into the television screen’.<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> Žižek points out that the appropriate ‘gesture of criticism’ towards the interpassive subject ‘is that, no, it was <i>not you</i> who laughed, it was the Other […] who did it’.<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Frenesi, having ‘learned to view her life as […] part of a movie’,<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> displaces this logic critical of interpassivity onto reality, a reality in which ‘even sex was mediated for her now’ (<i>VL</i> 237): in viewing her own actions as if watching a television screen she erases her own agency and complicity in the implosion of the radical movement. Mimicking an interpassive television viewer relieved of activity, and responsibility, Frenesi engages with her own actions as if viewing them voyeuristically from the distance of sofa to screen. But what she pretends to merely watch is the failure of a movement in which she, and the other aging radicals, were active participants.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement’s complicity with what Althusser classifies as the ‘Repressive State Apparatus’, the state apparatus that ‘functions by violence’ rather than ‘by ideology’,<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> is not just symbolised through Frenesi’s relationship with Brock Vond but is explicitly discussed throughout the novel. In <i>Vineland</i> Pynchon indicts both the emerging neoliberal state and, as Thomas Schaub notes, ‘the citizenry itself’.<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> The narrator credits Brock Vond with the ‘genius’ of seeing ‘in the activities of the sixties left not threats to order but unacknowledged desires for it’, a ‘need to stay children forever’, ‘[c]hildren longing for discipline’ (<i>VL</i> 269). Critics, including Schaub, have taken this passage as ‘a key insight of the novel’,<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> and yet Pynchon’s presentation of Brock Vond’s view is problematic. The association of the left with children is a clichéd bourgeois critique: as Herbert Marcuse recognised, any ‘at least temporarily successful attempt […] to break out of the repressive universe of the established political behaviour’ will and in fact ‘must appear as foolish, childish and irrational’.<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> Furthermore, the free-indirect narrator’s disgusted tone in describing ‘men who had grown feminine’ and characterising the radicals as ‘the sort of mild herd creatures who belonged, who’d feel, let’s face it, much more comfortable, behind fences’ (<i>VL </i>269) appears at this moment clearly contaminated by the worldview of ‘stupidly brutal, fascist Brock’ (<i>VL</i> 217). To take the statement at face-value and label it a direct insight of the novel is a severe misreading. Nevertheless, instances of right co-option and left complicity are implicit in many of <i>Vineland</i>’s narrative strands, from references to the ‘IA’ (<i>VL</i> 82), a stage employee union headed up in the thirties by corrupt management embroiled with ‘gangsters and studio bosses’ who were ‘more interested in breaking strikes than winning them’,<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> to the description of ‘the anticommunist terror in Hollywood’ during the fifties, a time ‘thick with betrayal, destructiveness, cowardice, and lying’ (<i>VL</i> 81). O’Bryan identifies the two predominant historical accounts of the sixties, two positions which <i>Vineland</i> encompasses ‘in a productive mutual tension’: ‘postmodern defenses of the rise of identity politics’ as ‘antidotes to the crypto-chauvinisms of the New Left’, and ‘more-or-less classically Marxist contentions that the New Left collapsed because of its decentralism and ideological heterogeneity’.<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> I would agree with O’Bryan’s premise: the character of Rex Snuvvle is ignorant of multiplicity, a clear parody of a reductive form of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism obsessed with ‘purity’ and seeing ‘the Revolution as a kind of progressive abstinence’ (<i>VL</i> 229); on the other hand, the narrator complains as the movement emerges that ‘[n]one of these kids had been doing any real analysis’ (<i>VL</i> 205) and end up chaotically ‘screaming politics all at the same time’ (<i>VL</i> 210). However, I disagree with O’Bryan’s contention that Pynchon offers anarchism as a privileged viable alternative situated between these two excesses. As O’Bryan suggests, ‘the anarchist impulse is embodied by Weed Atman’,<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> yet Weed is a less than admirable model: he leads by accident, having ‘ambled into celebrity’ as part of a ‘retrograde cult of personality’ (<i>VL</i> 205). He’s first appointed leader merely for virtue of being tall, and is seemingly mostly concerned with ‘the beat of rock and roll’ (<i>VL</i> 208) and ‘pleasant-looking women […] wearing provocative attire’ (<i>VL</i> 211) than political discussions which he smiles ‘absently’ (<i>VL</i> 208) through. It’s clear that Pynchon is critical of all strands of the 1960s movement, refusing to privilege any single doctrine.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;So what solutions does <i>Vineland</i> offer? Those which it appears to suggest are persistently undercut. Scholarship which reads a positive message in <i>Vineland</i> finds it in the novel’s ending, in which characters alive and dead from every historical flashback converge in the present to attend the Traverse-Becker family reunion. This reunion, providing ‘a communal physical space for four generations of left-wing radicals to interact’,<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> is so upbeat as to be utopian. Marc Conner, contrasting <i>Vineland</i> with Pynchon’s previous novels, writes that ‘the individual, the family, and the community are restored’ in an ending of ‘forgiveness, reconciliation, and regeneration’.<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> Such a positive reading is unconvincing, for the ending is unconvincing too. That the novel’s loose ends are farcically tied up so suddenly and conveniently is perhaps best represented by the fate of Brock Vond: dangling ‘in harness and cable’ (<i>VL</i> 375) from a DEA helicopter and about to abduct Prairie from the reunion, Brock’s funding is cut and he’s literally ‘winched back up’ (<i>VL</i> 376) into the sky in a parody of a <i>deus ex machina</i>. Pages later, with the novel admitting the intervening details are ‘vague’ (<i>VL</i> 378), Brock finds himself being driven by car mechanics Vato and Blood into the centre of the earth to be dropped off in hell. Joseph Tabbi criticizes the ending as ‘slapdash, indeterminate’,<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> but the ending is far too implausible to be unintentionally hollow. A key example is the final chapter’s opening image of a ‘pasture, just before dawn’ populated by ‘woodland creatures’ and ‘impatient kids already out barefoot in the dew’ (<i>VL</i> 323). The pastoral imagery combined with homely descriptions of families preparing for the day is undeniably heart warming, but, as Brooks points out, ‘hardly consistent’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small>: doCarmo is right in associating this ‘impossibly upbeat ending’ with the novel’s stylistic emulation of media ‘it elsewhere berates as oppressive, conservative or sometimes just inane’.<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> Even the Thanatoids get to ironically fulfil Jameson’s prediction of a slumbering left finally awakening, with the narrator registering how ‘unprecented’ (and illogical) this is, ‘like a class-action lawsuit suddenly resolved after generations in the courts’, through the disbelieving repeated exclamation ‘they woke, the Thanatoids woke’ (<i>VL</i> 325). <br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the pastoral ending, however, are subtle elements of unease. In the final paragraph of the book, just before the missing family dog miraculously show up at the reunion, Prairie returns to ‘the clearing where she’d had her visit from Brock Vond’ (<i>VL</i>384) and had almost been abducted. Her attitude is disconcerting: she feels ‘[h]e had left too suddenly’, that ‘[t]here should have been more’ (<i>VL</i> 384). She even quietly whispers into the sky, ‘You can come back […] It’s OK, rilly. Come on, come in. I don’t care. Take me anyplace you want’ (<i>VL</i> 384). Prairie’s echo of her mother’s attraction, to the very same Fascist embodiment of a repressive state that’s been terrorising her throughout the novel, suggests the political problems the novel thematises are far from resolved, despite the closeness of the Traverse-Becker family. Sean McCann and Michael Szalay put forward a similar argument when they argue <i>Vineland</i> offers ‘not a vision of political life but of spiritual communion – and indeed of refuge from a political realm viewed as overwhelmingly cruel and unjust’.<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> ‘However moving and beautiful’ <i>Vineland</i>’s ending may be, they argue, ‘it offers a highly limited understanding of political action and no model for contesting the genuine injustice that has characterized our recent history’.<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> Whilst I agree with the contention that <i>Vineland</i> is lacking a model of political action, I disagree that the novel’s understanding of political action is limited in the same way as <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>. The Vineland ‘commune’ that Zoyd and the other ex-radicals find themselves living in during the Reagan years is </p> <br>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p> lodged in the heart of a regionwide network of military installations that included nuclear-weapons depots and waste dumps, mothball fleets, submarine bases, ordnance factories, and airfields for all branches of the service, from SAC down to the Marines, whose flying stock, none of it equipped with noise suppressors, roared overhead without letup day and night (<i>VL</i> 306).</p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Pynchon does address local ‘injustices […] as humans, usually male […] committing these crimes, major and petty’ (<i>VL</i> 80), but he’s also aware of the type of injustice with which the passage above is concerned: the extent to which the unjust system underlying these specific injustices has achieved comically colossal proportions. The total society that <i>Vineland</i> depicts even serves to reinscribe what seemed the most concrete source of hope in <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, the mere existence of truly alternative communities in the margins of society. Their day did not come; instead, as Alain Badiou describes, ‘there is nothing more captive, so far as commercial investment is concerned […] than a community’.<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> Identities constituted in opposition to the mainstream provide ‘inexhaustible potential for mercantile investments […] taking the form of communities demanding recognition’ that really ‘never demand anything but the right to be exposed in the same way as others to the uniform prerogatives of the market’.<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> The alternative lifestyles of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>’s Scurvhamites and Inamorati Anonymous return in <i>Vineland</i>, commercialised and co-opted, as the Bodhi Dharma Pizza Temple and ‘New Age mindbarf […] dribbling out of the PA system’ (<i>VL</i> 330). What could possibly be salvaged from such a situation?<br><br>
