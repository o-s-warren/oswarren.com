		<h3>
		<br>The Whole Thing Frankly Ann Spells Experimental in Caps: Situating Ann Quin</h3><br>
		
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Aren’t You Rather Young to be Writing Your Memoirs?</i>, B. S. Johnson included Quin alongside Christine Brooke-Rose, Brigid Brophy, Alan Burns and others in a list of British novelists emerging in the 1960s and ‘writing as though it mattered, as though they meant it, as though they meant it to matter.’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> This loose constellation has been taken up as a literary moment by recent publications, configured as the ‘British Avant-Garde’ by Kaye Mitchell,<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> the ‘English Anti-Novels’ by Sebastian Groes,<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> and the ‘Avant-Garde Renaissance’ by Julia Jordan.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> One factor uniting Johnson’s otherwise somewhat disparate grouping is their tendency to theorise their own work and to situate themselves in relation to particular influences. As Johnson notes, they all ‘had some contact with a continental European tradition of the avant-garde’ and so realised ‘how stultifyingly philistine is the general book culture’ of Britain;<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> as Ian Patterson argues, ‘discovering the scope and ambition of modernist artists from Europe and America was an important task in Quin’s cultural world.’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> This chapter will proceed to consider how Quin and those she was grouped with situated themselves through a complicated relationship to the term “experimental.” First, however, I will delineate two key influences on Quin.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Julia Jordan sees the Avant-Garde Renaissance of the 1960s as ‘a generation defined by its straining at the boundaries of literary categorisation,’ motivated by ‘a preoccupation with truth, along with an attraction to images of negation, displacement, and the inadequacy of articulating knowledge through language,’ concerns which ‘were influenced particularly by Samuel Beckett.’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> That Johnson, who called Beckett ‘of all living […] the man I believe most worth reading and listening to,’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> took particular influence from Beckett has been well documented in scholarship such as Jonathan Coe’s <i>Like A Fiery Elephant</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> But Beckett also plays a special role in Quin’s writing and its reception: already in 1961 Quin was claiming in letters to be influenced by him, if ‘influenced by anyone,’<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> and in his 1964 review of <i>Berg</i>, Henry Williamson (at the time in a relationship with Quin) calls her ‘an avowed “disciple” of Mr Samuel Beckett’s work.’<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> Writing in the Carmelite <i>Aylesford Review</i> (edited by Quin’s friend Father Brocard Sewell), Williamson evokes Beckett in an attempt to argue that although ‘superficially <i>Berg</i> is a “sordid” story […] beneath the illusion of its “reality” one perceives a talent of rarity and grace,’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> perhaps a hopeful misrepresentation of Quin’s potential appeal to the <i>Review</i>’s religious readership. Later in the same issue Quin herself is given the opportunity to review Beckett’s <i>How It Is</i>, which she does thoughtfully and with a different perspective: ‘Alienation accepted, there being no alternative […] Beckett is surely one of the very few writers today who is not afraid of confronting things as they are.’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> This piece is Quin’s only published review, and has escaped the notice of recent scholarship on Quin despite its crucial value as a rare example of the author reflecting on literature and form. Quin approvingly applies Beckett’s phrase ‘unruffled by emotion’ to his own style,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> but the phrase also resonates with the uncanny lexis of Quin’s subsequent novel, <i>Three</i>. Quin’s own preoccupations are indicated in her laudatory description of Beckett as ‘a guide whose “vision” reorientates signs, and recreates something personal from a universal situation,’<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> ascribing to Beckett the ability to see through accepted conceptions to present a new and personally honest view of the universal situation. Her praise of such an ability leads us to Quin’s second major influence, the <i>nouveau roman</i>. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Key to an understanding of why Quin and those around her turned to the French <i>nouveau roman</i> is the widespread idea of British resistance to experimentalism. In her review of <i>How It Is</i>, Quin reproaches those that ‘turn away from Beckett, regarding such an innovator of words as “gimmicky,” and pretentious, because his work follows no recognisable pattern in theme or style.’<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Her adjectives are precise: Julia Jordan writes that ‘the 1950s had seen a critical backlash directed at formal innovation from a literary mainstream,’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> typified by John Wain’s description in a 1963 essay of experimental literature as ‘motivated by faddishness or the irritable search for new gimmicks.’<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> Such a view relied on a pervasive dichotomous logic by which David Lodge, in an influential 1969 essay, makes an ‘affirmation of faith in the future of realistic fiction’ against the ‘fabulation’ of experimentalism,<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> a dichotomy to be addressed later in this chapter. Lodge later dismissed Quin in a <i>TLS</i> review, suggesting that ‘one cannot help suspecting that the material which has been so conscientiously scrambled would prove, if one had the patience to reassemble it in coherent form, […] banal.’<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> Incongruous in Britain, where Johnson claimed in a 1965 lecture ‘the weight of prejudice against anything new is enormous and deeply rooted,’<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> the avant-garde turned to the <i>nouveau roman </i>to find influence, a movement Quin’s publisher John Calder called ‘more significant and exciting than anything produced here in the last 30 years.’<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundational practitioner Alain Robbe-Grillet described those writing the <i>nouveau roman</i> as ‘seeking new forms for the novel’ whilst understanding ‘that the systematic repetition of the forms of the past is not only absurd and futile, but that it can even become harmful.’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> Particular to Robbe-Grillet’s style is an attempt ‘to construct a world both more solid and more immediate,’ where it is ‘by their <i>presence</i> that objects and gestures establish themselves [….] mocking their own “meaning.”’<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Such a style is echoed in Quin’s descriptions, littered with inert objects. In <i>Passages</i>, place is only ever evoked with a spattering of concrete images, often unconnected: ‘icons, statues of saints dressed in tinsel, sequins […] Buses churned up dust, sand. Neon signs, day and night, red, yellow, blue.’<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> This technique is reflexively figured when the protagonists attend a party:<br>
		  <br></p>
		<div class="quotation"><p>
		  
		“I saw<br>
		<br>
		what did I see, for when that scene reappears it merges with a dream, fallen back into slowly, connected yet not connected in parts. […] Succession of images, controlled by choice. I chose then to remain outside. […] Only afterwards could I see things. More so now in specific detail. Objects in that room<br>
		<br>
		a wooden fish […] Black underwear, boots, whips. A rocking chair rocked. A leather strap […] Red seeds […] A record player […] Gutted candles, incense remains […] A round broken mirror.”<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small><p>
		  </div>
		<br>
		<p>
		  The scene that greets the protagonists and the reader is a succession of images in specific detail which, like the narrator, we remain outside of, engaging only at the level of objects. Many of the injunctions set out by Nathalie Sarraute, another founder of the <i>nouveau roman</i>, are also found in Quin’s novels: Sarraute, like Quin, sees ‘no justification for the heavy indentations and dashes with which we are accustomed to make a clear cut separation between dialogue and what precedes it.’<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> More significant is Sarraute’s theory of certain ‘subterranean actions,’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> which ‘hide behind our gestures, beneath the words we speak and the feelings we manifest’: these cannot be expressed by ‘interior monologue’, but only through ‘equivalent images,’ an exacting description of ‘the surface of the appearances that both conceal and reveal them.’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> For Sarraute, depicting subterranean actions requires characters ‘devoid of outline, indefinable, intangible and invisible.’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> Quin’s second novel <i>Three</i>, in particular, manifests such traits both in the character of S, the woman around whose absence the novel revolves, and in Ruth and Leonard’s halting and mechanistic movements, unruffled by emotion:<br></p>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>“He lit a cigarette, piled the pillows up, and rested against them. He picked up a mirror, grinned, a grin that grew into a frown, as his teeth gritted, jaw worked up and down. He rattled the handle.”<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small></p></div>
		<br><p>
		  As in the work of Sarraute and Robbe-Grillet, Quin denies access to Leonard’s interiority by demarcating only rattling gestures and straining surface. Characters are available to us with the solid but withholding presence of objects, the world constituted, in Robbe-Grillet’s words, as ‘smooth surface, without signification, without soul, without value’ in order that we look past learnt essentialisms and ‘find ourselves once again <i>facing</i> things.’<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Running through the sparse Quin scholarship is a patronising anecdote that the author had not actually read the <i>nouveau roman</i>: in what was the only published academic work on Quin for many years, Philip Stevick writes (without providing a citation), that Quin ‘had not read the French novelists whom she was seen to resemble.’<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Whilst he seems to mean this as a compliment, denying Quin’s influences to emphasise her originality or unconventionality, this claim’s repetition by critics as a belief that Quin ‘wrote, it is said, without reading,’<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> is dispiriting. The confusion appears to have arisen out of a note provided by Marion Boyars in Giles Gordon’s 1975 anthology <i>Beyond the Words</i>, which contained part of the novel Quin was working on at the time of her death. Boyars writes that Quin<br>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>
		  was compared with such diverse writers as Graham Greene, Nathalie Sarraute and Samuel Beckett. She had, however, a very individual style […] rather than [that of] those writers named above whom she told me she had not read seriously by the time she was compared to them. She did feel, unjustifiably in my view, that she lacked formal education, and in the last year of her life she went to Hillcroft College to prepare herself for university entrance.</i><small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small></p></div>
		<br><p>
		Yet Quin’s interest in the <i>nouveau roman</i> is explicitly demonstrated, besides the crucial stylistic and technical links demonstrated in the previous paragraph, by the fact that the plot of <i>Three </i>is partially appropriated from Robbe-Grillet and Alain Resnais’ <i>Last Year at Marienbad</i>, as she mentions in a <i>Guardian</i> interview,<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> whilst in letters to Carol and Alan Burns three years before <i>Berg</i>’s publication, Quin notes reading Sarraute’s <i>Portrait of a Man Unknown</i> and being ‘reminded […] of my own work’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> whilst naming her influences as ‘a mixture of Sartre, Beckett and Ingmar Bergman.’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> Quin was clearly reading Beckett ‘seriously’ too, as demonstrated by her <i>Aylesford Review </i>piece. Boyars and later critics have, perhaps with good intentions, attempted to downplay Quin’s influences by taking what appears to be Quin’s modesty about the depth of her reading, or rather a self-effacing anxiety about a lack of formal education, at face value. This theoretical move seems especially unproductive today, playing into the dismissal of the sixties avant-garde as ‘a Shandyean digression in the master narrative of British literary history,’<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> rather than what Julia Jordan identifies as a ‘generative cluster of movements in their own right,’<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> that also constitute ‘an important prefiguring of current debates about modernism’s legacy.’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> With Quin’s cultural world firmly situated within a more nuanced trajectory of mid-twentieth century late-modernist and European avant-garde influence, the next section of this chapter will consider her role more particularly within this moment of British experimental fiction.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;While Hodgson’s introduction to <i>The Unmapped Country</i> describes Quin as ‘a rare breed in British writing: radically experimental, working-class and a woman,’<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> what “experimental” meant to Quin and her contemporaries is by no means straightforward. Hodgson’s other terms are far from straightforward either: although I haven’t had space here to address the issue of Quin’s class background, which despite Quin arguing ‘never bothered’ her is certainly deserving of further scholarship,<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> I will be discussing the question of gender in this dissertation’s final chapter. Quin published very little reflecting on her “experimental” method, but what the term meant to Quin’s cultural moment and milieu can be usefully explored through the extensive reflections of the writers she associated with herself and was associated with by others. The term “experimental” is one with baggage: in a 2013 essay recuperating the British avant-garde novelists of the 1960s from ‘the peripheries of literary history,’ Hodgson laments how ‘both then and now […] the vague, slippery epithet “experimental” […] has tended to preclude rigorous critical engagement,’ signifying instead ‘aesthetic or commercial failure or, worse, a questionable politics and a narcissistic artistic dandyism.’<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> The binary between realism and experimentalism, which ‘in the second half of the twentieth century […] was represented as a central tension,’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> has been extensively deconstructed in recent scholarship on this period: as Lyndsey Stonebridge and Marina Mackay note, such a dichotomy ‘has also, and not always merely incidentally, stamped many mid-century writers as irretrievably and disastrously minor.’<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> Likewise, Andrzej Gasiorek forcefully argues that such a dichotomy construes realism as a stable ‘set of narrative techniques, and experimentalism as their subversion,’ which is ‘inadequate’ in failing to account for each as ‘a heterogeneous phenomenon,’<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> recalling Lodge’s assumption in the <i>TLS</i> that Quin is merely scrambling a pre-existing straightforward realist narrative. Despite its theoretical weakness, that Quin wrote around a pervasive attitude prejudiced against the “experimental” is demonstrated in a letter to Robert and Diane Sward: <br>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>“Made the unfortunate mistake of showing Don Hutter at &nbsp;Scribners that 1st part of novel - &amp; like he just didn’t have an inkling of wot I’m up to […] with him saying things like: […] The whole thing frankly Ann spells Experimental in caps. My only answer to this was to say Well if it turns out a ghastly failure it really doesn’t matter as it’s something I’ve just got to do.”</i><small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>To understand the situation of being admonished with the term “experimental” in 1966, it’s worth turning to two of Quin’s contemporaries who wrote extensively about exactly this phenomenon, B. S. Johnson and Giles Gordon.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;A key document of Quin’s cultural world is Giles Gordon’s <i>Beyond the Words: Eleven Writers in Search of a New Fiction</i>, published two years after Quin’s death and containing writing by Quin, Johnson, Eva Figes and Alan Burns among others. Gordon later reflected that the anthology aimed to provide ‘an antidote, a counterblast’ to mainstream realist fiction of the time.<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> The anthology emerged from conversations between Johnson and Gordon regarding the list of writers in <i>Aren’t You Rather Young to be Writing Your Memoirs?</i>, although the day the book was commissioned was the day that Johnson, like Quin a few months earlier, committed suicide.<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> In <i>Memoirs?,</i> Johnson explicitly rejects the term experimental, which he sees as a synonym for ‘unsuccessful,’ and objects to the term being applied to his work,<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> a term that in an earlier lecture he had called ‘the dirtiest of words.’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> Gordon, in his introduction, agrees: ‘if a novel is labelled experimental or avant-garde by a reader, then it seems to me that the book has failed […] to be a novel.’<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> Indeed, as David Hucklesby suggests, Johnson’s and Gordon’s thesis might better be characterised as a reimagining of tradition.<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> As Johnson puts it, ‘the novelist cannot legitimately or successfully embody present-day reality in exhausted forms’;<small><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small> when he does ‘depart from convention, it is because the convention has failed, is inadequate.’<small><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small> Quin’s work, I will go on to argue, demonstrates a similar belief in the necessity of innovation not in and of itself but as a response to ‘present-day reality.’ For Johnson and Gordon, such a belief reflects a wider social commitment to scientific advancement: both authors were obsessed with what Johnson called ‘the technological fact of the book,’<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small> consistently attempting to utilise cutting edge novelistic technology in pursuing what they saw to be a greater realism and Johnson’s ‘almost puritanical commitment to writing reflecting a writer’s personal truth.’<small><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Darlington points out that ‘the 1960s was a decade of progress and, specifically, of progress framed in the discourse of scientific management’;<small><a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></small> in his 2001 introduction to an American reissue of <i>Berg</i>, Gordon praises how the novel ‘employed the <i>technical advances</i> of the nouveau roman,’<small><a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></small> and Hucklesby argues that, in his introduction to <i>Beyond the Words</i>, ‘Gordon’s arguments are coloured by a changing technological culture surrounding reading.’<small><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></small> Such an atmosphere was reflected by Johnson through the repeated metaphor of architecture: Albert Angelo is by vocation an architect, and Johnson tells us that ‘the architects can teach us something.’<small><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></small> Johnson’s lecture compares novelists to ‘contemporary architects,’ with their responsibility to ‘radical new techniques (ferro-concrete, plastics, new finishes) which they are painfully, with many bosh-shots, learning how to use.’<small><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a></small> Although ‘experiment’ as a term is rejected, Johnson and Gordon embrace a scientific, technological discourse to describe their own and other’s writing. Other contemporary avant-garde authors also self-consciously reflected on novelistic form: Alexander Trocchi’s 1960 <i>Cain’s Book </i>states that ‘writing which is not ostensibly self-conscious is in a vital way inauthentic for our time,’ that we can no longer ‘take the old objective forms for granted.’<small><a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a></small>&nbsp;Johnson, prolific as a novelist and journalist whist also appearing on television and radio, was the loudest voice in resisting the anti-experimental literary mainstream, despite despising “experimental” as a pejorative label, and is thus a crucial source in understanding the nature of the negative reception Quin received. Johnson and Gordon also, however, point to an available discourse of scientific innovation; Quin’s texts, as I will demonstrate later in this chapter, fit uncomfortably into a model of precisely controlled tests with concrete results. Amongst those writing “experimental” fiction in the 1960s, however, there were a variety of perspectives, including those who found theoretical and formal richness within a thoughtful adoption of the otherwise negative epithet. The most useful of these figures for thinking through Quin’s position is Christine Brooke-Rose.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Quin herself did not write prose reflecting on her texts and their contexts, Brooke-Rose wrote frequently ‘about the situation of “experimental” women writers’ as ‘Three words. Three difficulties.’<small><a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a></small> Putting to one side the second, gendered difficulty, which I’ll be addressing in the concluding chapter of this dissertation, Brooke-Rose wrote expansively on experiment in essays, articles, and book reviews. In a 1965 article for <i>London Magazine</i>, in which Quin’s autobiographical piece was published the following year, Brooke-Rose writes that ‘it is legitimate to criticise […] experimental writers in relation to what they are trying, implicitly or explicitly, to do. But let us first grasp what they are doing.’<small><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a></small> Brooke-Rose is more explicit than Gordon or Johnson in her use of a scientific discourse, demanding that ‘we must evolve a new way of thinking and reject the old universalistic and absolutist concepts, especially our habit of identification, just as the scientists have done,’<small><a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a></small> and ‘attempt to evolve a language that corresponds structurally to what we know of empirical reality today.’<small><a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a></small> Some of Brooke-Rose’s terms can be usefully applied to Quin: the prose style of <i>Three,</i> and to a lesser extent <i>Passages,</i> recall Brooke-Rose’s characterisation of Nathalie Sarraute’s <i>The Planetarium </i>as an attempt to treat ‘the intensively subjective […] with total scientific objectivity,’ in which ‘half-conscious movements and murderous impulses are viewed like organisms caught and enlarged in an electron microscope.’<small><a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[69]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooke-Rose also comments that ‘the poet’s attitude to reality is closer to that of the scientists than to that of the novelist, both being concerned with cosmic “truths,” however relative, behind the physical appearances,’ advising that the novelist ‘must every now and then draw strength from this source’;<small><a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70">[70]</a></small> Quin expresses a similar sentiment two years later, in a letter to the organisation funding her travel to the United States: ‘What the poets are doing is something I wish the novelists would turn to, and this is: to senses of form, to the literal nature of living in a given place, and to a world momently informed by what energies inhabit it.’<small><a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71">[71]</a></small> Where Brooke-Rose takes Johnson’s theories further, demonstrating an attitude I will argue aligns with Quin’s, is her view that the experimental artist ‘tests and tests his [sic] hunches about the reality behind appearances, and he tests them in the matter which is language.’<small><a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72">[72]</a></small> Johnson admits as much: ‘certainly I make experiments, but the unsuccessful ones are quietly hidden away and what I choose to publish is in my terms successful.’<small><a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73">[73]</a></small> But Johnson’s brash confidence, or perhaps self-conscious bluster, leads him to a somewhat astonishing perspective on authorial control: ‘I want my ideas to be expressed so precisely that the very minimum of room for interpretation is left,’ and in fact, ‘to the extent that a reader can impose is own imagination on my words, then that piece of writing is a failure.’<small><a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74">[74]</a></small> Johnson’s notorious need for control over his texts and their reception would not allow him to admit to experimentalism, especially within a culture that saw “experimental” as pejorative. However, the fact that both he and Brooke-Rose were invested in a process of formal innovation as method of attaining newly precise truth about ‘empirical reality today’ is deeply revealing of what Quin’s work meant within its context. As Brooke-Rose reminds us, ‘it is often forgotten for instance that the <i>nouveau roman</i>, when it burst out in the fifties, first acquired the label <i>nouveau réalisme</i> […] just as earlier literary “revolutions” since Wordsworth had been made in the name of a greater realism.’<small><a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75">[75]</a></small> Although Quin wrote very little regarding the form of her novels, material from her archive show that she, too, was intensely engaged with the situation which Johnson and Brooke-Rose delineate, and that the word “experimental” is particularly appropriate to her method in ways unique among her milieu.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1967, Quin had read John Cage’s <i>Silence: Lectures and Writings</i>,<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76">[76]</a> later published by Calder &amp; Boyars, and Marion Boyars would argue after Quin’s death that ‘if any influences are to be found in her later work’ then ‘it seems […] appropriate to name […] John Cage.’<small><a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77">[77]</a></small> Cage writes in his ‘Experimental Music: Doctrine’ that ‘experimental’ should be ‘understood not as descriptive of an act to be later judged in terms of success and failure, but simply as of an act the outcome of which is unknown,’ that one should ask of the work: ‘what has been determined?’<small><a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78">[78]</a></small> Williams stresses that ‘Quin’s intertextual and reiterative prose is deliberately risky and provocatively eclectic […] encompassing a wide range of source materials and textual forms, the patterns and connections between them sometimes haphazard and incidental, the effects unknown.’<small><a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79">[79]</a></small> Quin’s risks were often greeted with a hostile reception, but Quin continued to seek new forms regardless. Responding to a negative review of <i>Passages</i> in a letter, Quin stressed the importance of innovation and experiment as an end in itself, a process: ‘Well so it goes and what the hell, one goes on with some kind of conviction and/or just the sheer need to find out what is there.’<small><a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80">[80]</a></small> Williams stresses that Quin’s use of uncited quotation and intertextuality is experimental ‘precisely because the connections and ripples of association are in flux and the outcome(s), or effects, are necessarily unknown, created by a play of associations and part-repetitions that the reader may or may not “get.”’<small><a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81">[81]</a></small> However, what Williams misses in her astute analysis is Quin’s uniqueness within her particular context: as I will argue, her thematic preoccupations uniquely situate her in relation to unmapped country, to what is unknown.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin’s novels are concerned with what is by nature obtuse: porous subjects, obscure dynamics, uncanny gestures and fluctuating perspectives. The formal repercussions of exploring such territory give Quin’s work a fundamental instability, and the reader’s subsequent interaction with it is, in Cage’s sense, an unknown outcome in relation to which failure and success are less important than experience. Quin wrote in a letter to Robert Sward that, borrowing Beckett’s phrase, she was ‘concerned more in “how it is” [sic] not with how it should/could be,’<small><a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82">[82]</a></small> but her work demonstrates an awareness that ‘how it is’ was, in some respects, volatile and in flux. This marks her apart from the prose of her contemporaries: while Johnson’s theoretical writing rejected and Brooke-Rose’s embraced the vocabulary of experiment, the novels that both produced are very different to Quin in a similar way, predicated as they are on tight control and constraint. Johnson’s <i>House Mother Normal</i> (1971) relays the same events from nine perspectives, each line of each 21-page section precisely reflecting the corresponding lines of the other sections, whilst Brooke-Rose’s <i>Between </i>(1968) is written without the use of the verb ‘to be.’ Like the work of Oulipo, which Brooke-Rose predated, these are experiments that are delineated and defined, controlled and precise, in a manner very different to Quin’s more diffuse experimentalism.<small><a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83">[83]</a></small> They thus offer readerly anchors, despite their departure from conventional narrative models; as I will demonstrate in the next chapter, in Quin’s difficult work such anchors are few and far between.<br>
