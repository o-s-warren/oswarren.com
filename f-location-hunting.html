		A fascinating document of Pasolini at work. Seeing him on screen and hearing his voiceover you can really feel the depth of his engagement with the Gospel of Matthew and the way it links so powerfully to the veneration of the lumpenproletariat he was most known for before his third film.
		</p><br><p>
		Some particularly insightful moments casts the oft-repeated claim that an atheist director and an agnostic actor created the most spiritual depiction of Jesus in a new light - Pasolini is shown here as not only uncomplicatedly atheist, and speaks of the resonances which the expressions of Don Andrea (his priest tour guide) have with 'certain reactions from my childhood' (having been bought up in Venetian liturgical Catholicism). The conversation with Andrea on religious spirituality vs aesthetic spirituality is a useful way in to that element of Pasolini's work, too.
		</p><br><p>
		John Berger wrote that Pasolini had the comfortless lucidity of angel, and we really see his love for his subjects in this film (the scene with the Bedouin children is especially tender) - and this documentary confirms to us, as the making of it did for Pasolini, that the deepest and most beautiful aspect of Christianity is not its grandeur but the barren and humble land upon which the religiosity of the Church sits like a hawk. A good primer for <i>The Gospel According to Matthew.</i>
