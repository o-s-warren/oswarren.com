		    Bergman supposedly watched this over a hundred times, and spoke of its fundamental significance to his career often. Besides as an exercise in considering filmic influence (and seeing the origin of <i>The Shining</i>’s Here’s Johnny scene was fun), watching this today is a powerful experience in itself - Sjöström‘s performance and characterisation of David Holm is remarkably subtle for a character that could otherwise be so two-dimensionally evil, bringing a tangible pathos to his destructiveness without excusing it. The scenes are visually great, with taut compositions and shifting cutting rhythms that chart a path through the film's complex nested structure. That structure, adeptly exploiting the montage-based innovations into filmic time of the previous few years, seems especially important - for this is a film about narratives, ghost stories and morality tales, the way they are communicated (and the urgency with which they have to be retold in the right way) and the way they they resonate within and shape the course of a single life.

		(Also, I’d definitively recommend the Matti Bye score over the score by Stephen O’Malley and Peter Rehburg (as KTL). Even though I love Sunn O))), and I think the score is a fantastic piece of music in its own right, it definitely flattens the mood of the film into just unsettling - while there’s some interesting stuff happening with harmonic resonances in the ‘positive’ scenes, it’s way too subtle to change the tone of the soundtrack away from anything other than ‘relentless dread.’ I get that the structure of the film does mean this makes sense (if we treat all of the flashbacks as having a kind of glaze of the present’s terror), but it seems such a shame for a film that’s got such an emotional range.)
