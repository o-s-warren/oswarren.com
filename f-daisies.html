			<p><i>Daisies</i> exists loudly, disjointed and frenzied as it castrates pickles and gorges on ice cream, fish bones, a bath of milk. Does it matter? It doesn’t matter, creak Marie 1 and Marie 2 (‘<i>Vadí?</i>’ ‘<i>Nevadí</i>.’). <i>Vadí</i>: An
				out-of-pocket scientist weeps and waves his handkerchief as his train departs. <i>Nevadí</i>: Marie and Marie groan in boredom and burst out laughing. <i>Vadí</i>: I wish I never met you cries the lepidopterist as he hammers the piano keys and
				begs a Marie to take her clothes off. <i>Nevadí</i>: Marie yawns and asks if there’s any jam for her to eat before prancing down the stairs. The film, after a title sequence of clanking machinery and military footage of explosions, begins with
				our two sunbathing protagonists realising that the world is spoiled, so why not be spoiled too? So they steal some apples, empty handbags onto the floor, swing from chandeliers. Their main hobby, though, is tricking old men into paying for
				their dinner, though they also get down to the important work of screwing up a well-to-do night and setting fire to their own apartment. All the while accompanied by xylophone scales, wide-eyed hamming and woody the woodpecker giggling. Sounds
				pretty annoying, maybe, depending on who you ask.</p>

			<br>

			<p>And that depending is really what’s essential to making the film so many shades of great: ask director Věra Chytilová and she’d tell you the marionette Maries are ‘parasites’; she maintained throughout her life that <i>Daisies</i> was a
				denouncement of its ‘malicious’ and ‘empty’ heroines. Ask the Czech cultural commissioners and they’d say the film ‘lacked a positive attitude to socialism,’ and that way too much food was wasted in its production. Ask a pearl-clutching 1966
				issue of Time Out magazine and they’d lament the ‘havoc in restaurants and nightclubs, ripping off unsuspecting men and generally eating and behaving like pigs,’ to which the only sane response is Yes but That’s Good, Actually. Because watch it
				with any audience that doesn’t hate fun and it’s impossible not to love their wicked playfulness, chirping and drink-swiping.

			<p>These hot takes about proper behaviour served fresh from the Sixties are worth engaging with in a way, though. Because, sure, the film on paper sounds tiresome (and it’s worth remembering that the commissars would check every film script
				during pre-production). But the end result resolutely isn’t that: it’s joyous, it’s funny, it flies frenetically through a lean 70 minutes where nothing of major significance really happens (sharply thrown into relief with the bookends of
				actual explosions). The Maries are hard not to identify with, or at least root for, even though they spend the runtime acting like five-year olds bored at a grown-up dinner party. Or maybe it’s because they’re five-year olds, and therefore
				intuitively right about things in the way most five-year olds are. The contradictions of the corrupted Socialist officials having quite so much cash and fancy Western-branded food to be tricked out of, for example.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>On top of its charmingly sweet-fanged content, the film’s visual texture is absolutely stunning; Chytilová maintains that budget constraints led to the constantly shifting types of film stock, although the end result is way too exciting for
				that to be true. With the collaboration of her cinematographer husband Jaroslav Kucera, a devotee of American Underground Film obsessed with the materialism of an autonomous cinema, the film’s radical in-camera visual techniques create a rare
				bridge between the European and American Avant-Garde. The Prague Film School <i>FAMU</i>, where much of the Czech New Wave came up, was open to the work of the Co-op movement whilst the <i>Cahiers</i> gang rejected it for its involvement with
				the established art world (an involvement <i>Daisies</i> profits by - Schneeman’s <i>Meat Joy</i>, for example, is all over this thing). One of the most striking images is when the girls take scissors to their outfits, then each other’s
				unexpectedly detachable heads and limbs, then the very surface of the 35mm itself - fragments of live celluloid showering the screen like glitter confetti. The disembodied body parts gasp, then giggle: <i>Vadí? Nevadí.</i> This scene is merely
				the most literal-minded example of M1 and M2's exuberant actualisation of patriarchy’s feminine partial objects into Frankensteinian omnivores, monstrous mannequins hearkening the gleeful destruction of manhood - cut to the unnerving close-ups
				of the Marie’s cheerfully chopping up sausages, bananas, pickles. Chytilova stated that <i>Daisies</i> was structured to ‘restrict [the spectator’s] feeling of involvement and lead him to an understanding of the underlying idea or philosophy.’
				There’s plenty of conceptual gristle to get your teeth stuck in to if you want to - spoiling and being spoiled, productivity and expenditure, authenticity and the death drive - but there’s a whole Commissar’s banquet to feast on here, and the
				guests are nowhere to be seen.</p>
