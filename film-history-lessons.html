		  History Lessons (1972)
		</h3>
		<h4>
		  Directed by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet
		</h4>
		<br>
		  <p>
		The density of history as broached by and through the present. Like Straub and Huillet’s previous feature, <i>Othon</i>, <i>History Lessons</i> transposes an exacting text into contemporary Rome (there a play by Corneille, here an unfinished Brecht novel) - yet where <i>Othon</i>’s relentlessly fast dialogue was overwhelming (and, in many ways, about the ways in which speech can contain both overpowering weight and empty lightness), here the text is more fluently didactic. This is helped by the framing device of a modern deep-voiced inquisitor, interviewing four contemporaries of Caesar: as they offer up their understandings of Caesar, the film becomes about frameworks, about overlays and narratives within the lived experience of oral history. But it’s also assuredly filmic in its radical approach to text, maintaining a constant disjunctive opening between the visible and the audible; this, as per Straub/Huillet’s practice, is a film of precise layering, in which (as Deleuze put it) ‘it is as if the earth is buckling from what the voice is telling.’ Finally the film spews forth an invocation, through Bach, for a wreck and ruin that’s a long time coming.
