		<h3>
		<br>Full and Dense and Limited Too and Narrow: Ann Quin and Difficulty</h3><br>
		
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In approaching Quin’s texts – which, as we’ve seen, have a complex relation to the designation “experimental” – our reading must be attuned to the different but related question of difficulty: a reading involved with complexity, concealment, complicity and contradiction. Although the two are often conflated or used interchangeably in mainstream discourse, “experimental” and “difficult” are distinct terms: the first a label that attempts to illuminate an authorial attitude or process, the other an adjective relating to the way in which texts face the reader. That practitioners of work considered either “difficult,” “experimental,” or both recognised this distinction is demonstrated, for example, in Gordon’s embrace of difficulty in <i>Beyond the Words</i> in the course of rejecting the label “experimental”: if ‘the reader of a book has difficulty immediately interpreting its territory, why shouldn’t this be regarded as a challenge?’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> On the other hand, Robbe-Grillet ‘resented being considered a “difficult” author,’ since he was ‘eager to write for the “reading public.”’<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> Quin’s neglected <i>Aylesford Review </i>piece on Beckett is unique within her oeuvre in setting out her view of textual difficulty. In considering that ‘to read a page of any of Beckett’s work is to be confronted as though by an entirely new, mysterious, and seemingly complicated language’; Quin writes that:</p><br>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>The meaning at first is not apparent in most works of art that have any real and lasting value. Perhaps only some time afterwards does comprehension set in, when the initial impact has sifted through, stripped off the layers of conditioning.<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Quin’s phrasing resonates with a letter sent two years earlier to Brocard Sewell, explaining whilst writing <i>Three</i> that the book is not, yet, ‘expressing more truly myself.’ Her experimental process is ongoing, and the letter’s language deploys a similar corrosive metaphor to that which she uses to describe the experience of reading Beckett: ‘I think it will take many years before I strip off the layers of “spectres” in my own nightmarish way.’<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> This chapter aims to address the difficulties in Quin’s writing, to delineate those difficulties and attend to them across her texts as a means of conveying the particularity of her lasting value. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;An important preliminary point: the meaning of Quin’s “difficulty” has shifted between the cultural moment in which she wrote and her current revival. Deborah Levy, in a recent of issue of <i>Music &amp; Literature</i> partially devoted to critical appreciations of Quin by contemporary writers, reproaches the attitude of contemporaneous reviewers: ‘few critics gave her books the respect of a close reading […] as if Quin was culturally forbidden to possess a coherent literary purpose.’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small>Dismissiveness grew the further Quin’s career progressed: reviewers commented that <i>Three</i> ‘yields nothing much beyond gallant experimental intention,’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> and that <i>Passages </i>was ‘irritatingly opaque and elliptical.’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> What seems clear, however, is the gendered dimension that often exists in the reception of difficult novels. In a review of <i>Tripticks</i>, Robert Nye wishes that that ‘Miss Quin will chuck the box of tricks away to write a whole book in which observation of the heart’s affections is permitted to predominate,’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> suggesting with an allusion to Keats that Quin was withholding some kind of linear realist romance narrative. Nye’s bizarre request that Quin start writing completely different books to those that she was then writing is arguably tied up with the expectation that women, and women writers in particular, have a duty to write texts of generous intelligibility, of comforting emotional labour that reassures readers of their ‘heart’s affections.’ Quin is clearly interested in no such thing, and to subsequently reduce all that her works could offer besides that as a mere ‘box of tricks’ is short-sighted in a particularly sexist way.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Today’s attitude to critical difficulty is harder to pin down. Discussing today’s reviews of Quin, Nonia Williams notes that, while, in a complete reversal, reviews of <i>The Unmapped Country</i> have tended to be ‘solely celebratory,’ Quin’s ‘recuperation, in terms of renewed positive critical attention,’ must also ‘take seriously some of the contemporaneous, more negative responses to the work.’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> That the current, solely celebratory response tends to elide the nature of Quin’s challenging texts is borne out in Ben Lawrence’s <i>Telegraph</i> piece on Quin, which begins by promising the reader that ‘Quin is the opposite of “hard work.” Exuberance and humanity blossom from her prose, which is also very funny.’<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> This fertile floral metaphor, assuring us that Quin is an assuring read, is uncomfortably close to the discourse surrounding women writers as typified by Nye in 1972. Statements such as these do a great disservice to the complexity of Quin’s demanding texts, and whilst the novels are often funny, the idea that they ‘blossom’ forth anything like exuberance in their complicated style or dark themes seems a fundamental (and frankly improbable) misreading. Instead, this chapter aims to read the novels attentively, attuned to what is difficult, in a spirit truer to the investments of Quin herself. As her close friend Robert Sward wrote after her death, Quin asked ‘only and essentially that one pay full attention… Ann’s life was so full and dense and limited too and narrow, drawn many times very close in on itself, haunted and with demons, marked and worn with the past.’<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;For Williams, the key challenge in Quin’s work is the use of intertexts, which create ‘difficulty and unease […] by frustrating expectations of progression, linearity, originality, coherence, closure and so on.’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Such intertexts exist thematically: as Danielle Dutton argues, <i>Berg</i>’s ‘farcical violence’, in which action is repeatedly deferred and displaced, serves ‘to denature the Oedipal myth to the point of rendering it no longer tragic.’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> But there are also uncited borrowings and appropriations, which are digested into the text to varying degrees. Berg writes a quote from Horace, ‘<i>non omnis moriar’ </i>[I shall not wholly die], on his bedroom mirror,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> while in <i>Three</i> Leonard’s conversations with S about botany, for instance telling her ‘all orchidaceous plants are hybridised in this fashion,’<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> deploy sentences directly appropriated from a textbook.<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> In <i>Passages</i>, Quin’s intertextual technique reaches a new intensity through a slippery, shifting style in which scenes seem to be constantly shifting and the connections between sentences is often unclear. Many sentences are disguised appropriations: ‘Eat hands full of ashes, saints have lived on them. Are you better than a saint?’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> is an uncited quotation of William Carlos Williams’ <i>Kora in Hell</i>, with angels replaced by saints,<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> and the formulation ‘the strangeness of natural things and the naturalness of strange things’<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> comes from a comment André Gide used to describe poet Henri Michaux.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> These quotations sometimes draw attention to themselves: the idiosyncratic spelling and phrasing of ‘every debarkation an attack’ suggests that this could be appropriated,<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> although without attempting to locate its source, it’s unlikely many readers would recognise it as directly lifted from Kafka’s diaries.<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> The availability of searchable digitised texts and online databases makes identifying Quin’s citations easier now than when she was writing. While still relying on a hunch that the phrase might be an unattributed quotation, the critic no longer has to draw on their own reading, and the accusation that disguised citations rely on an equally wide range of reading to the author no longer applies. Yet this gets at an important point: Nonia Williams cites the phrases of <i>Passages</i> which are recognisably borrowed from unrecognisable sources as ‘useful for considering the reader’s potential unease and infuriation when reading Quin’s texts’ because of how they ‘feel excluding.’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> Of course, Quin’s own lexis is often jarring and evocative: extensive research into a seemingly appropriated phrase which results in no leads leaves a residue of uncertainty about whether a phrase is a Quin original (and whether that even matters).<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst reading da Vinci’s notebooks, Quin writes Sward a letter revealing her awareness of the disjunction between authorial knowledge and what can be expected of the reader: she describes having ‘taken notes down and used some of his descriptions in my own work, juxtaposing the words (shhhhh you’ll be the only ONE who’ll know what a “fraud” I really am!).’<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Quin’s understanding of appropriation in terms of juxtaposition is most apparent in her final novel, <i>Tripticks. </i>Self-describing as ‘a book out of quotes,’<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> to use its own narrator’s phrasing, the text thematises its own jarring style through metatextual reflections on its kaleidoscopic nature: ‘An infinite variety of angles and perspectives. Cannot be identified, does not affirm any order but has its own interrelation of parts, colour, scale and touch.’<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> <i>Tripticks</i> ends with a reflexive crescendo about the possibility of agency of speech, implying the experimental style reflects the surface of society: ‘I opened my mouth, but no words. Only the words of others I saw, like ads, texts, psalms, from those who had attempted to persuade me into their systems.’<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> Quin demonstrates here how hegemonic rhetoric exerts itself ideologically on the capitalist subject to constrain the parameters of speech and thought: ‘independence of expression has now become almost unthinkable.’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> Instead, the text functions as a stream of fragmented discourses, appropriated from TV, comics, pulp fiction and advertisements. The reader can’t possibly identify the individual sources but instead must engage with their disorientating collective texture, the text metaphorically evoking itself in the image of ‘Television Russian Roulette,’ in which the viewer is forced to ‘fatalistically watch whatever film materializes […] usually a bouquet of commercials.’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> As her letter to Sward suggests, Quin is completely open about the disparity between the author’s knowledge of the text and that of the most likely confused reader: this re-emphasises Quin’s connection to John Cage, and the truly experimental work’s unknown outcome, in its conviction that a fundamental part of the experience of Quin’s work is the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing. What is difficult in <i>Tripticks</i> is not a confusion that can be cleared up, or an obstruction that can be resolved through following up Quin’s allusions. What matters is the <i>felt quality</i> of the language being from elsewhere, whether from the hyperactive juxtapositions of collaged literary sources or the cultural deluge of ‘ads, texts, psalms,’ and the difficult feeling of disorientation that comes with the way in which these texts don’t quite fit together. The text cannot be settled or fixed down through identifying its sources in an attempt to confer meaning and intertextual authority, and instead demands the reader be caught up in what Quin calls the ‘restless kaleidoscope.’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Burns writes that ‘Ann’s writing contains areas of shadow, inhabited by shadow images, areas of association, which slip further and further away from the text’ with her ‘talent for throwing off ripples of association.’<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> These ripples and shadows that slip away from Quin’s texts can be usefully addressed through Sianne Ngai’s conceptualisation of <i>Ugly Feelings</i>: the feeling of not knowing is exacerbated by what is persistently uncomfortable in the work being diffuse and uncertain, felt but difficult to point to. Ngai argues that ‘certain kinds of ugly feeling (paranoia, disconcertedness) become maximized when we are most uncertain if the “field” of their emergence is subjective or objective’;<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> the meta-uncertainty of such ugly feelings is particularly apparent in Quin’s short story ‘A Double Room’ (1966). Terse, clipped sentences written in a third-person free indirect style depict the seaside holiday of a young woman protagonist and a married older man, a situation immediately figured by the opening page’s description of the landscape: ‘flat. Dreary. Endless.’<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Some paragraphs end unpunctuated, mid-sentence, cut off by the white of the page: </p><br>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>Ah well love it doesn’t matter does it I mean<br>
		<br>
		  Wardrobe door creaked.<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>The story’s style is generally flat: ‘cosy domestic mornings. Reading the papers together. Quietly sipping tea.’<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> Yet Quin manages to convey a palpable sense of what we might call horror or dread, rendered all the more disconcerting by the fact that what is unnerving in the text’s portrayal of a mundane affair’s ‘little rituals’ is difficult to ascribe to any particular formal feature.<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> As Ngai writes, ‘tone is never entirely reducible to a reader’s emotional response […] or […] the text’s internal representations of feeling (though it can amplify and be amplified by both).’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Ngai’s understanding of tone as a ‘text’s affective bearing, orientation, or “set toward” its audience and world,’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> it seems appropriate to name the tone of ‘A Double Room’ as a kind of depressed hostility towards bourgeois monotony. This is not directly expressed by the protagonist’s judgements or opinions, although occasional moments when she exhibits a restless energy of ‘anticipation anticipation anti anti antiantiantiantiantianti’ convey her panicked, uncomfortable attitude; nor does it seem possible to ascribe such an attitude to any explicit narrative or descriptive feature of the text. The most palpable manifestations of horror in the story occur through the protagonist’s descriptions of voicing or of the unvoiced. She is consistently alienated from her expressions: towards the story’s end, she reflects on hearing her voice on the phone by stating ‘her own. That was not her own. Voice,’<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> and the moments in which she comes closest to directly expressing horror similarly present the emotion as a violent alien presence in her throat, emerging not as a scream but a cough: ‘The scream moved up into the lump. A fist thrust in her throat. Spread out. The scream emerged in a coughing bout.’<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> Beyond such moments, horror seems to pervade the texture of the story itself: the monotonous rhythm, the disparity between the man’s easy-going platitudes and the sharp and precise narrative voice within which that speech is embedded, and the pathetic fallacy of the miserable weather. Overheard speech, along with signs and other texts read by the protagonist, are presented in the same clipped sentences, so that interior and exterior, thought, action and setting are all rendered with the same contained flatness, approaching but never quite reaching panic: a ‘scream’ that ‘couldn’t. Wouldn’t. Be forced out.’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> Such near-panic arises from a subtle oppressive quality residing in the surrounding world, from the man’s ‘Heavier. Insistent. Demanding’ snoring,<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> to the ‘Ceiling. Cracked yellow.’<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> All of these elements coalesce into an amorphous and uncomfortable <i>tone</i>: the difficulty of fixing this as a manifest textual affect leaves the reader with a similarly lingering, self-conscious disconcertedness, an alienation resembling Ngai’s description of ‘an aesthetic engagement fostered by distanciation […] a distance attained not <i>from</i> feeling, but <i>by</i> feeling.’<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> The uncomfortably diffuse affects provided by ‘A Double Room’ are present throughout Quin’s work, and to neglect what is ‘challenging’ or ‘difficult’ in the material elides this fundamental quality.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disorientating technique which Quin uses throughout her oeuvre is a relentless proximity: detail and part are described in a manner which tends to obscure setting and whole. <i>Berg</i> suggests the way in which accumulated and disconnected fragments echo the mind’s workings, asking ‘does memory alone dwell on detail[?],’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> but it is in Quin’s later novels<i> </i>that the technique is extended furthest. A contemporaneous review of <i>Passages</i> complains that particularities ‘are expressed with lucidity and directness’ but that ‘the juxtaposition of precisely caught experiences, apparently unconnected,’ give a ‘confused overall shape’; despite this, the reviewer sees value in the book’s confusion being a ‘truthful […] record of real movements of the mind,’ like the ‘reactions of a traveller’ as their ‘senses acquire a new responsiveness to detail.’<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> This reading of Quin, following a criterion of value familiarly used when characterising stream-of-consciousness, is taken up by Stevick when he argues that Quin’s style is an attempt to convey ‘mind caught and fixed in words on a page,’<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> although this dissertation is more interested in the ontological claims of Quin’s style over epistemological readings such as these. <i>Passages</i>itself consistently theorises its own form, describing what appears to be the basis of Quin’s experiment as aiming ‘to arrive finally at a unit with contradictory attributes never moulded or fused together, but clearly differentiated.’<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> Jesse Kohn ascribes to the novel ‘a wholeness built of ruptured parts which, not only do not cohere, but exceed the whole they comprise,’<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> but Kohn’s gesture towards <i>Passages</i>’ excessive fragments is perhaps even more pertinent to the style of <i>Three</i>, in particular the transcriptions of S’s tapes. The layout of these sections exploits the white space of the page to emphasise the text’s fragmentary nature:</p> <br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p>This incoherence of parts refuses the reader a stable position within the text. More challenging, however, is the way that Quin applies the logic of this style to characters and narrative perspective.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin’s experiments with narrative perspective informed by her particular engagements with subjectivity begin in <i>Berg</i>. The text presents itself through what is apparently third-person free indirect style which includes direct and unpunctuated speech but, troubling this definition, much of that speech appears to chart Berg’s unspoken thoughts, and much of the narrative voice’s distinctive style sounds as if spoken by Berg himself: Berg as despotic third-person narrator of a story in which he farcically fails to make any progress in his monomaniacal goal of Oedipal revenge. In order to understand the way the narrative voice conveys Berg’s obsessive and narcissistically sensitive character, and to track the gradually shifting pronominal movements between third-, first-, and even second-person narration, it’s worth quoting extensively across the movements of a single paragraph. With Berg lying face-down in a street amongst ‘coloured tickets, spent out balloons, contraceptives […] satisfied, attuned to my world,’ suddenly the perspective switches (without warning or explanation) to the past, as Berg reminisces about the ‘dormitory pleasure’ of his school days and being bullied, and we appear to enter Berg’s thoughts or memories before being drawn back out suddenly by Berg’s father coming across him without realizing Berg is his son:</p><br>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>he’s a cissy, just a common cissy; hasn’t got a dad, his mum pawns herself […] Could the exterior world denounce him, when he was so willing to resign—but are you that willing? Contradictions seemed the very symbiosis of an age that refused accepting a oneway ticket to no-man’s land. I’ve torn mine up a long way back […] a sticky sickly child, who longed to be accepted with the others, […] But once on your own, when you lorded it with beast and flower […] then nothing mattered, because everything comprehended your significance. He swayed in the middle of the road, looking into his father’s eyes […] Berg stepped back […] The old man tottered […] Hey wait a minute aren’t you the chap who’s taken the room next door, Number 18?<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small><br></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Kate Zambreno attributes to the novel a ‘claustrophobic interiority,’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> whereas Lee Rourke calls it a ‘schizophrenic ventriloquism.’<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> Both of these epithets are accurate: while the novel expresses a single interior voice, this perspective presents itself with the authority of an omniscient narrator; it’s impossible to know where Berg ends and the world begins. Despite refusing any outer limits to his perspective, Berg is far from omniscient: Dutton describes the narrator as ‘part of, or trapped in, Berg’s own considerable limitations,’ and thus not ‘one we can turn to for clarity or truth,’<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> and what seems to be speech is never clearly ‘internal or external, […] from the past, present, or presumed future,’ real or ‘purely fantasized.’<small><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small>&nbsp;The novel is transgressive not just thematically but formally; the boundaries of <i>Berg</i> are porous and unstable because the boundaries of our only guide in <i>Berg</i>’s world – Berg himself – are porous and unstable, an interior subjectivity tyrannically grasping and consuming the world around in order to transmit it to the reader in the form of world-as-Berg. <br>
		<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude towards a porous subjectivity is the thread that runs through all of Quin’s varied work and disparate styles. In a brief piece on Quin, then ‘unknown,’<small><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small> in her 1997 guide to twentieth-century women novelists, Kathleen Wheeler summarises that ‘all [Quin’s] novels raise, in slightly different ways, questions about personal identity and individuality – the multiplicity of the self and its relation to other “selves.”’<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small> Other critics make similar points when discussing Quin’s oeuvre as a whole: Zambreno writes that ‘it was through Ann Quin I truly began to consider that it is not one voice that makes up a fictive consciousness,’ but ‘many voices, speaking through strange proxies and static […] crowds inside of our heads.’<small><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></small> Stevick argues that Quin’s stylistic traits, such as shifting pronouns and merging discourse, ‘serve the thematics of Quin’s fiction, which always involved the dialectics of a highly narcissistic self and another or others […] threatening and impinging […] making unignorable claims’ of ‘insight alternating with opacity, desire alternating with defensiveness.’<small><a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></small> There is a trajectory across Quin’s work, however: Quin in letters describes <i>Berg</i> as ‘a necessary struggle to free myself from inhibiting constrictions,’<small><a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></small> and an ‘exercise […] that would open on to other areas, other routes’;<small><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></small> the novel’s porous intersubjectivity is extended and pluralised in Quin’s later work. <i>Three</i> opens with Ruth and Leonard reflecting that ‘they can’t really be sure’ if S’s death was deliberate or accidental;<small><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></small> Williams points out that, through this, uncertainty is immediately ‘announced as the destabilising core of the text, as well as the key problem of interpretation.’<small><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a></small> S’s presence in the text only as crucial absence serves to frustrate the reader’s attempts to delineate her. Likewise, throughout the novel, the undifferentiated voices of Ruth and Leonard merge to produce a confusing mesh that is hard to disentangle, with clipped sentences often impossible to attribute absolutely to either spouse: </p><br>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>[T]he Council should do something about it. I ought to write them again. At least they should clear the rubbish away. Disgusting God knows what’s there. I can’t—daren’t look […] As if we haven’t enough junk. Mostly hers Ruth. Yours. Father’s then.<small><a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>The couple interrupt each other and themselves as they obsess over the absent figure of S and discuss the literal and symbolic ‘rubbish’ of the past accumulated in their domestic space, and the rendering of their meandering conversation with a numbing rhythm, pounding and indistinct, acts as a disquieting depiction of their stale and hollow marriage. The experience of reading this is often itself tedious and uncomfortable: the reader themselves is trapped within bourgeois mundanity’s claustrophobic confines, and forced to either gloss over passages as a kind of undifferentiated mass conveying a mundane but hostile tone or make a futile and laborious attempt to discern who said what, as if themselves a participant in their bickering. To ignore the difficulty of such a contentious and combative reading experience is to ignore a key thematic challenge of the work.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Passages</i>, similarly, both the man’s sections and the woman’s sections reveal their identity and subjectivity to be distinctly difficult to demarcate. The man’s section is made up of two columns, which often seem completely disconnected but are similar in that neither is easily definable: presenting itself as a diary on the right of the page with a left column of occasional annotation, both diary and annotation include a range of discursive tones, unattributed and unpunctuated quotations, punctuated speech with no indication of speaker, first-, second- and third-person pronouns, lists and set-apart fragments. The woman’s is perhaps even less straightforward: suggesting itself as a linear narrative, it consists of paragraphs of roughly equal length that often start or begin mid-sentence. Time and place frequently shift between paragraphs, but also within paragraphs and even seemingly within single sentences. The perspective appears to be that of the woman, although she often refers to herself in the third person:</p><br>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>I found a message at the hotel, and took a cab to the address. The shutters closed. It did not look like a government building. She rang the bell several times.<small><a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a></small></p></div>

		<p>Since Quin’s refusal to provide background or whole is most heightened in <i>Passages</i>, and in particular in these sections, the reader cannot be sure if any given ‘she’ is the narrator or another character: knowing who exactly is in the room at any given moment, or even what or where that room is, is a luxury denied throughout the text. The book corresponds to its title’s various meanings: discrete textual units or excerpts from elsewhere, but also paths or routes, migrations and expeditions, transitory movements across or through space, time, or state which don’t necessarily arrive at their destination.<small><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a></small> Jordan notes that, in Quin’s novels, ‘objects lose their definition and merge into each other with fluidity,’<small><a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a></small> and the same can also be said of place, time, and subjectivities. The reader is given no reassuring grounding in this world, only flashes of fragmented perceptions so intensely felt that they are hard to discern as purely exterior: the narrator’s boundaries are indeterminate, as in <i>Berg</i>, but <i>Passages</i> passes over and across all of the outer limits it depicts, troubling the outlines of places, plots, objects, and people.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;While the difficulty of Quin’s work can be elucidated in this way, to conclude this chapter, I want to briefly suggest what in Quin’s work <i>necessitates</i> such difficulty: her particular thematic investments, the problems she is attempting to solve through her experimental techniques. In 1965 Nell Dunn published <i>Talking to Women</i>, a collection of frank and intimate interviews with her friends, of whom Quin was one. Dunn’s opening question is ‘Do you feel you know how you want to live now?’ to which Quin answers, at an obtuse angle and with a self-interrupting grammar that is difficult to parse: ‘Day-to-day living for me is sort of coping inasmuch as I want to work I find the immediate moment gives one a whole experience, and therefore I hate anything to be very rigid or set.’<small><a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a></small> Quin signposts a few of her preoccupations at this early stage of her career: valuing a ‘whole experience’, which can be found in the ‘immediate moment,’ having a desire to work from or on this whole experience, and the idea that rigidity is antithetical to immediacy, presence, or wholeness. With this in mind, it is worth returning to the notions of experimentalism and realism explored in the previous chapter: Sarraute, who Quin had read whilst beginning to write herself, states that a ‘realistic writer […] applies himself [sic], while making an effort to […] neither trim nor smooth anything for the purpose of overcoming contradictions and complexities, to seizing with all the sincerity of which he is capable […] what appears to him to be reality.’<small><a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[69]</a></small> Quin clearly worked in this spirit, and so her novels must be difficult, obtuse, uncomfortable and occasionally mundane, for this is the reality which she sincerely seized. Wheeler notes that Quin’s novels propose that ‘the realist imposition of order through its various conventions is quite arbitrary and unrepresentative of our experience.’<small><a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70">[70]</a></small> Quin herself rhetorically asks Robert Sward in a letter: ‘Christ what need have we for fabricating when it’s all there?’<small><a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71">[71]</a></small> What is there, however – the ‘whole experience’ or the ‘immediate moment’ – does not reveal itself within the illusory order of transparent clarity provided by realist fiction. Hodgson notes Quin’s interest in the ‘space in-between […] inner and outer, thought and action, fantasy and reality, past and present, reason and the instincts, words, languages, bodies.’<small><a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72">[72]</a></small> In themselves, these are common explorations within modernist and experimental writing; Quin’s most important proposal, unique within her context, is that she makes through her investments in the difficulty of delineating subjectivity and identity, and this dissertation’s final chapter reads these proposals as prescient and urgent.<br>
