		  L'Eclisse (1962)
		</h3>
		<br>
		  <p>
		A film that seems to resist the usual modes of engagement at every step - certainly the most disconcerting of the alienation trilogy. Maybe the most articulate about speechlessness and unknowingness too, but eloquent muteness still leaves the viewer without anything to grip on to (besides the visual beauty, which is stunning). The opening scene sets up the film’s narrative and compositional strategies: without any kind of establishing shots, the apartment disperses outwards, each new framing revealing further rooms for the characters to fail to grasp each other across. Also, we have no idea who these people even are: the film starts at the end of a relationship, or rather just after the end of a relationship, and then one of the characters essentially disappears from the movie (classic!). It works, though, because the despairing emotional content of the film happens around and in between the dissolving plotlessness. And the film isn't concerned with changes or shifts (as represented by the break-up having already happened), but instead the non-temporal ambivalence of feelings which we find it hard to own or even recognise. When Vittoria says she doesn't know, it comes from a sense of clarity (both Antonioni and Vitti understand how Freud abrogates the law of non-contradiction).
		
		The pacing is more complicated than just slowness (and really its more frustrating, and not necessarily in a negative sense, than boring). Much of it meanders and digresses, not only in the movement between self-contained scenes but within them - so many shots continue after what we assumed to be the subject has left the frame, Antonioni insisting we keep looking. But there are also moments that resist this movement productively. I think it’s important that both the stock market scenes (featuring real stockbrokers!) and the visit to the neighbours apartment refuse to be absorbed into the fabric of the whole - each engages with a particular aspect of capitalist violence (financial abstraction and white supremacy) that undergirds the bourgeois ennui the film is concerned with, a logical departure from the hollowed-out industrialism of La Notte, and Antonioni doesn’t hesitate to associate each scene with literal death (the heart attack, and the animal carcasses as furniture). Once Vittoria and Piero begin their romance long after the film's midpoint, a narrative shape briefly comes into focus before dissipating again. And then, of course, in the final sequence the film becomes something else entirely - and the air vibrates with the weight of emptiness.</p>
