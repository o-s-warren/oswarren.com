		<br>Conclusion</h3><br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, then, how did Pynchon’s understanding of the sixties change, and what did this change tell us about the expression of political possibility at the end of the 20th century? In Chapter One, I demonstrated that <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> emerged from and was representative of a hopeful millenarianism, unconducive to social change but assured of its possibility. In Chapter Two, a wiser, wearier, Pynchon emerged, demonstrating in <i>Vineland</i> not only the failures of the sixties but the extent to which the possibility for radical change was irretrievable. Instead, the later Pynchon is concerned with critical thinking, and revealing total society in all its distortion. Chapter Three, through an engagement with the works of Theodor Adorno, discovered how not only is Pynchon’s pessimistic mode of thought a truly honest response to the situation in which he found himself, but how that pessimism becomes, at a level of both content and form, an expression in negation of utopian possibility: the only form of expression that Adorno believed remained possible.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;This project can be extended in a variety of ways. Firstly, examining the relation of Pynchon’s other novels to the trajectory I’ve documented: <i>Gravity’s</i> <i>Rainbow</i>, written between the two novels I’ve chosen to study, would be a clear next choice. But so would <i>Bleeding Edge</i>, preoccupied with the internet and the 21st century, and <i>Mason &amp; Dixon</i>, Pynchon’s exploration of 18th century America in which the assumptions of Enlightenment Rationality are questioned at their source. The Enlightenment, or rather the <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, is perhaps the other next step of this project: the history of disenchantment and re-enchantment which Adorno and Horkheimer chart out has striking parallels with the novels I have chosen. For example, real estate and its relationship to the domination of nature both internal and external is a key motif in all of Pynchon’s California novels (including 2009’s <i>Inherent Vice</i>), while the re-enchantment of modern society as somehow natural is parodied in moments such as Pluto going into retrograde in <i>Vineland </i>(<i>VL</i> 260). Finally, another direction this project could be extended into is an exploration of the relevance of both Pynchon and Adorno to the political thinking of today. The 20th-century total society which Adorno described, and Pynchon depicted, still bears great relevance to our contemporary existence, a time in which truly fundamental social change seems unimaginable. By confronting their pessimistic thought directly and by sharing their sincere but necessarily negative expression of hope, we can achieve glimpses that something other than what we know is possible, and excavate a ‘philosophy that can be responsibly practised in face of despair’.<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small><br>
