		<br>Introduction: Accepted by an Unseen Audience</h3><br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2018, Ian Patterson wrote that despite ‘scarcely even maintaining a cult reputation among writers in the years since her death’ in 1973, Ann Quin had ‘reappeared like a revenant who’d been lurking in dark corners, and now everybody’s writing about her.’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> The publication of <i>The Unmapped Country: Stories and Fragments</i> at the beginning of that year received universal acclaim in a range of UK newspapers and literary magazines, and the republication of Quin’s debut novel <i>Berg</i> in March 2019 has led to its reappraisal as ‘a must-read masterwork,’<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> and a ‘triumph.’<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> Quin’s growing popularity is also attested by the homages recently made by authors including Isabel Waidner, Juliette Jacques and China Miéville,<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> and Jennifer Hodgson notes that although ‘as a “cult” author, her influence is difficult to point to with certainty […] there’s something distinctly Quin-like […] present in many of the most interesting contemporary writers: Eimear McBride, Claire-Louis Bennet, Ankara Schofield.’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> Within academic circles, however, very little has been written on Quin; until 2018 the only published scholarship dealing exclusively with Quin was a chapter in Ellen Friedman and Miriam Fuchs’ <i>Breaking the Sequence</i> and two journal articles written in 1999 and 2003. Given this, the first chapter of this dissertation will aim to situate Quin’s writing within a few key literary contexts, centred around the way she and those associated with her related to the term “experimental.”<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> The second chapter explores the experience of reading Quin, starting with the question of difficulty; through a series of close readings I will argue that Quin’s current reception elides her texts’ refusal to make concessions to reader expectations and traditions of reading, and that in fact the thorny difficulty pervading her work is vital to its affective resonances. The dissertation’s concluding chapter considers how Quin, overlooked by the feminist scholarship of her time and in the years after her death, engages with gender: building on the work of the previous two chapters, I will argue that her texts’ affective investments and formal innovations allow them to anticipate later feminisms and queer theory through Quin’s prescient attitudes to identity and intersubjectivity. Throughout the dissertation I shall be reading across Quin’s oeuvre in an attempt to explicate the value of the burgeoning ‘renaissance of interest in [Quin’s] work,’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> by delineating it within a particular context of influences and contemporaries, and indicating how these texts anticipate later theoretical scholarship and present-day socio-political concerns.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Before addressing the literary contexts for Quin’s work in this dissertation’s first chapter, I will briefly introduce her life and work: four completed novels published during her lifetime and one incomplete, published posthumously, alongside a small number of short stories. As described in a brief autobiographical piece published in <i>London Magazine</i>, Quin was born in Brighton in 1936 and sent as a child to a convent which gave her ‘a conscience. A death wish and a sense of sin. Also a great lust to find out, experience what evil really was.’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> She read ‘books discovered in the Public Library: Greek and Elizabethan dramatists […] Dostoievsky […] Woolf […] Chekhov, Lawrence, Hardy,’ and at school was ‘more stimulated by the girl who had a crush on me, than hearing about the Poor Law.’ &nbsp;Evoking the references to Antigone and Oedipus in <i>Berg </i>and <i>Passages</i>, Quin tells us that: ‘At fourteen I met my half brother for the first time and fell desperately in love with him; he died five years later and I saw myself as Antigone.’ Aged eighteen, Quin spent Saturdays with her father in London; she writes that ‘he had left my mother when I was ten’ and that she ‘pretended he was my lover.’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> While the way such moments in Quin’s autobiographical piece neatly accord with the themes of her novels raises the question of its reliability, these details are corroborated in her letters. Quin passed one GCE, English language, having ‘failed in literature’;<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> planning a career as an actor, she turned to writing after getting stage fright at a RADA audition and deciding that ‘what I had to express, say, would be my own interpretation, my own vision […] accepted by an unseen audience.’<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> Quin spent the next few years doing secretarial, hotel, and waitressing work in Brighton, London, Cornwall and Paris, beginning what she called in a letter to Kitchen an ‘eternal wanting to escape from one thing or one place to another, […] never […] happy to settle down anywhere for long.’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> It was during these years that she had her first breakdown and saw a psychiatrist, although she writes that she ‘decided to climb back out of madness’ because ‘the loneliness of going over the edge was worse than the absurdity of coping with day to day living.’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on her friend’s life and work, Paddy Kitchen writes that Quin often ‘struck out in a new direction, but never straining to be original […] not one of those authors who self-consciously strove to be an innovator,’ Quin ‘had to seek a different form for each theme which occupied her mind.’<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> Each of her published works takes a different form, though all can be characterised by particular manifestations of difficulty. Quin wrote <i>Berg</i> (1964) in evenings and at night while working as a secretary at Chelsea College of Art. It deals with a man’s consistently frustrated attempts to kill his oblivious father while becoming entangled with his father’s mistress and a stream of letters from his own mother, narrated in a theatrical free indirect style disquietingly close to its protagonist’s wild imaginings. Published and promoted by Calder, it was highly acclaimed, winning Quin a D. H. Lawrence Scholarship from the University of New Mexico and a Harkness Fellowship to spend time living and writing in America. Quin’s second novel, <i>Three </i>(1966), follows married couple Ruth and Leonard as they work through the suicide of the young woman known only as ‘S’ who stayed with them and with whom each was romantically or sexually involved. Like <i>Berg</i>, the majority of the text stays claustrophobically close to its characters, but in a way that revokes any sense of their interiority: the text combines unpunctuated speech with remote descriptions of gestures and objects and excerpts from journals and tape-recordings. <i>Passages</i> (1969) concerns two protagonists, a man and a woman whose perspectives and characteristics often seem to blend, searching a desolate Mediterranean landscape for the woman’s missing, and likely dead, brother. The novel takes two alternating forms: unconnected paragraphs that often end or begin mid-sentence, shifting unpredictably between third and first person, and an annotated but obtuse diary. Quin’s final novel, <i>Tripticks</i> (1972), is a cut-up pastiche of the American road trip novel using the appropriated lexis of mass culture to describe a man alternately chasing and fleeing his three ex-wives. The text is surrounded by Carol Annand’s artwork, appropriating similar sources including comic books and advertisements. While <i>Berg</i> was successful, and remains Quin’s best known-work, Quin’s later works were often criticised for their difficulty by contemporaneous reviewers, an attitude attributed by Quin’s publisher more to changing climates of English readership than to the works themselves.<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> Before her death Quin partially completed a novel, titled <i>The Unmapped Country</i> and posthumously published in 2018, the surviving sections of which are narrated in a straightforward third-person voice telling the story of a woman living in a psychiatric hospital. In August 1973 Quin was seen walking into the sea on Brighton beach, and was pronounced dead upon the recovery of her body two days later. Her novels gradually fell out of print in the years that followed.
