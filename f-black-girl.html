				<i>La noire de...</i> (literally translated as <i>The Black Girl of...</i>) is a stark portrayal of the contradictions and deprivations of post-colonial identity as it relates to the white-supremacist hegemonic discourse of the former
				coloniser. The film follows Diouana (in a tremendously subtle performance by non-professsional actor M’Bissine Thérèse Diop) as she leaves Senegal to work as a nanny for a white couple in Marseille. It soon becomes apparent that the ineffectual
				Monsieur and spiteful Madame intend her to work as a maid, and the film charts her deteriorating sense of self under their dehumanising gaze.

				Sembène was an interesting figure: a member of the Communist Party whilst living in Paris and Marseille, he began writing after seeing the voice of his country missing from the union libraries. After a year at a Soviet film school in Moscow,
				Sembène went on to become the first black African filmmaker, and Black Girl was the first African film to receive international attention. Sembène retained a sense of cinema as a site of ideological contestation throughout his career, and he
				would consistently focus on Pan-African issues of independence, religion, the nature of the new African Bourgeoisie and relation to the West. His films would often find success abroad, and yet he would always foreground film's potential for
				political education within Africa, stating that 'the West is my market, Africa is my audience.' Unfortunately, his films were often censored or banned in West Africa, and received far more attention abroad than at home. Nevertheless. he did
				achieve his dream of producing a film in his native language Wolof in 1968, and is today is widely considered the father of African film.

				<i>Black Girl</i> is available through Criterion in a beautiful restoration (along with Sembène's earlier short film <i>Borom Sarret</i>, which is also fantastic) and is well worth seeking out not just for its historical significance but for
				the unflinching approach to its subject matter, and a truly staggering final act.
