		  A Dialogue with the Doctor: Foucault and Psychoanalysis
		</h3>
		<br>
		<div>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Foucault’s relationship to psychoanalysis was a complex one. He was resolute that he had ‘never been a Freudian’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small>, and yet Derrida wrote that psychoanalysis was ‘that from out of which he speaks’.<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> Modern critics reductively group together ‘the state, society, and the unconscious’ as Foucault’s ‘principle enemy’<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> without considering the specifics of Foucault’s position, in many ways entangled with Freud. In this essay, I’ll be analysing Foucault’s complicated relationship to psychoanalysis in two major works from the beginning and end of his career, <i>Madness and Civilization </i>and<i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i>. I’ll be treating psychoanalysis as related to but very much distinct from psychiatry, through the use of the unconscious and the centrality of transference to treatment. I’ll also, following Foucault, be concerning myself with Freudian psychoanalysis, and thus be according central importance within that discipline to the figure of Freud. While Foucault’s angle of critique changes between the two texts, what remains consistent is ambivalence: to demonstrate this, I’ll be attempting to expose the equivocation of the moments Foucault does praise Freud, but also to excavate the credit within his critiques.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;It is in <i>Madness and Civilization</i> that Foucault acknowledges that Freud had re-opened a conversation with unreason through psychoanalysis. However, Foucault qualifies his statement in a variety of ways. His claim’s first formulation comes in the final paragraph of ‘Doctors and Patients’, where he writes that Freud ‘restored, in medical thought, the possibility of a dialogue with unreason’.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> Already, there’s a complication: while ‘an experience of unreason’ is ‘involved in psychoanalysis’, we aren’t told the nature of this involvement; while dialogue’s ‘possibility’ is confirmed, Foucault doesn’t address whether this possibility is fulfilled or not.<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> Unreason speaks, ‘reconstituted’ at ‘the level of its <i>language,</i>’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> but a dialogue requires more than a single voice speaking. It is not until later in the text, in ‘The Birth of the Asylum’, that Foucault expands on this failure of psychoanalysis: he begins to praise the reinstitution of ‘exchange’ before retreating and ‘rather’ settling on an image of Freud beginning ‘to listen’.<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> Yet what Freud hears is ‘henceforth eroded into monologue’ by an ‘absence of language’ on the side of reason.<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> As Foucault foreshadowed in ‘Doctor and Patients’, dialogue is made possible but does not occur: Foucault subtly link Freud’s listening with an implied suppressive violence. As Lisa Downing explicates in psychoanalytic terminology, psychoanalysis ‘converts’ the voices of unreason ‘into the articulation of a <i>symptom.</i>’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> What first appears as acknowledgement is immediately undercut by admonishment: ‘psychoanalysis can unravel some of the forms of madness; it remains a stranger to the sovereign enterprise of unreason’.<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> Damningly, the dialogue opened up is one in which ‘psychoanalysis has not been able, will not be able, to hear the voices of unreason’.<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> This firmly turns his earlier acknowledgement into a denunciation of psychoanalysis’ conversation as ultimately monologic and oppressive not just historically but by nature.<br>
		 <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Foucault explains the reasons for unreason’s monologue through the metaphor of the psychoanalyst as Thaumaturge, ‘a worker of marvels or miracles’.<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Whilst Foucault credits Freud with having ‘demystified all the other asylum structures’, he also accuses him of having ‘exploited’ and ‘amplified’ the ‘thaumaturgical virtues’ of ‘the medical personage’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> Psychoanalysis takes these virtues from the psychiatric lineage of Tuke and Pinel (whom Freud described as having undertaken that ‘most humane of all revolutions’),<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> Foucault’s primary target. As Dreyfus and Rabinow phrase it, ‘the power and effectiveness of the therapist was both given its true importance by Freud and, at the same time, covered over by a further myth of scientism.’<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> It is important to understand that these two processes are interconnected: Freud’s power and effectiveness, Foucault argues, is contingent not on science but scientism, the occult-like valuation of science as a kind of universally valid authority, which instils the figure of the analyst with a specific importance. Foucault is referencing ‘the doctor-patient couple’, vital for transference and thus the work of psychoanalysis, which he depicts as one of ‘self-surrender to a doctor both divine and satanic’.<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Foucault’s exposure of the ‘magical nature’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> underlying psychoanalytic technique is not on its own a critique; it is the power relationship the Thaumaturge produces that Foucault objects to. Just as the voices of unreason were objectified and therefore silenced, so ‘the doctor dissipates the reality of the mental illness in the critical concept of madness’ leaving real only ‘the doctor-patient couple in which all alienations are summarized, linked, and loosened.’<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> As Derrida formulates it, Freud is not aligned with the artists of the ‘Conclusion’ who manifest the life of unreason, but shown to have ‘participated […] in the order of the immemorial figures of the Father and the Judge, of Family and Law, in the order of Order, of Authority and Punishment’.<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> If the possibility of dialogue is re-opened by Freud, then the figure he assumes in the psychoanalytic method is unsuitable for interlocution: instead, it is a figure of alienation and ‘maximum’ power.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small><br><br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;If, as Derrida argues, grouping Freud with Authority and Punishment implies the ‘putting on trial’<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> of psychoanalysis, <i>Madness and Civilization</i> does not deliver a purely critical judgement. In his repressed first book, Foucault affirms ‘Freud’s stroke of genius’ as ‘going beyond the evolutionist horizon’ to ‘reach the historical dimension of the human psyche,’<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> whilst he also ‘for the last time […] appropriates Freudian terminology.’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> Similar psychoanalytic tendencies are excavated from <i>Madness and Civilization</i> by Joel Whitebook, when he pointedly summarises the text’s arguments using psychoanalytic terms: ‘just as the individual externalizes the “bad” parts of themselves outside the boundaries of the ego, Foucault seems to be saying, the medieval town “extrojected” its intolerable members.’<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> That Whitebook is able to use these terms without rejecting Foucault’s argument suggests Foucault is working within a framework harmonious to Freud’s, an argument backed up by the preoccupations of his first book and ‘his Diplôme de Psycho-Pathologie from the University of Paris.’<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> Whitebook gleefully implies Freud and Foucault’s affinities when he includes Foucault in the lineage of the ‘hermeneutics of suspicion,’<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> identified by Paul Ricoeur as instigated by ‘Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.’<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small><b> </b>Derrida makes a similar point when he writes that ‘Foucault regularly attempts to objectify psychoanalysis and to reduce it to that of which he speaks rather than to that from out of which he speaks’, placing Foucault in an ‘age of psychoanalysis.’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> While Foucault may not acknowledge Freud’s influence over his method, stating in interview that his text ‘is neither Freudian nor Marxist nor structuralist,’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> there are still some explicit words of praise. While Freud may have failed to fulfil the possibilities of dialogue with unreason that he opened up, he is still ‘the first man to accept in all its seriousness the reality of the physician-patient couple.’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> The language with which Freud’s actions are described here is that of commendation, not condemnation: he performs ‘an inspired short-circuit’;<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> he is the first to not ‘look away’ from ‘the reality of the physician-patient couple.’<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> Although Foucault may want to subvert our complacency about an assumed nobility in the psychiatric and psychoanalytic traditions, he still grants Freud a personal bravery and intelligence. Over the course of his career, however, Foucault would come to take fuller aim at psychoanalysis, in a way simultaneously more surreptitious and circumspect.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;For arguably Foucault’s most aggressive critique of psychoanalysis, it’s at first disconcerting that ‘Freud is hardly mentioned’&nbsp;in <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Freud’s diminished role seems especially unusual in contrast to the latter sections of <i>Madness and Civilization</i>, where it was argued ‘all nineteenth century psychiatry really converges on Freud.’<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> This discrepancy is more readily understood when viewed through Whitebook’s claim that throughout his career Foucault repeatedly attempted to ‘exorcise the spectre of Freud,’<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> and perhaps by assuming that in this final attack Foucault is conscious of Freud’s claim that ‘hostile feelings are as much an indication of an emotional tie as the affectionate ones, in the same way as defiance signifies dependence as much as obedience does.’<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> It is only at the end of part four of <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i> that Foucault reveals that what he has presented, ‘the history of the deployment of sexuality’, in fact functions as ‘an archaeology of psychoanalysis.’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> Foucault’s term archaeology refers to a method of history focused specifically on ‘a level where certain objects (for example madness) are formed as possible objects of knowledge,’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> a methodical technique which Bernauer and Mahon read as an attempt to ‘undermine.’<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> In Foucault’s ‘earlier writings’, including <i>Madness and Civilization</i>, this archaeological undermining of psychoanalysis was based on ‘an identification of its power-knowledge relations, especially its dependence upon a medical model.’<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> Foucault shifts his target in <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One </i>to ‘the role psychoanalysis plays in the modern deployment of sexuality,’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> and by doing this is able to argue that what society ‘had attributed solely to the genius of Freud had already gone through a long stage of preparation’<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> which, as Whitebook observes, reduces Freud to ‘a bit player’<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> and psychoanalysis ‘a minor episode’<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> within that deployment. Derrida picks up on this too, noting how Foucault reduces psychoanalysis to ‘a very circumscribed and dependent moment in a history of the “strategies of knowledge and power” (juridicial, familial, psychiatric).’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> It appears that, in this final attack, Foucault is determined to undermine not only psychoanalysis but the significance of psychoanalysis to his project.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;But why could Foucault be so concerned with his relationship to psychoanalysis? An answer can be found when he self-consciously speaks of his ‘objective,’<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> where he confesses ‘that an uncertainty runs through the sketches I have drawn thus far.’<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> He has been attempting to argue against the repressive hypothesis, which views ‘the history of the last centuries in Western societies’ as manifesting ‘the movement of a power that was essentially repressive.’<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> But through this, he has been ‘feigning ignorance’ of a similar critique conducted ‘in a more radical fashion’: the psychoanalytic theory of desire, where ‘the law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it is predicated.’<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> After delineating that theory Foucault begins again to talk about himself, how ‘in an obstinately confused way, I sometimes spoke, as though I were dealing with equivalent notions, of <i>repressions</i>, and sometimes of <i>law</i>, of prohibition or censorship.’<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> It’s clear Foucault feels he has not distinguished his use of these terms, from each other and from their use in psychoanalysis. This feeling perhaps links back to his affinities to psychoanalysis, implicitly evident<i> </i>in <i>Madness and Civilization</i>. In his 1971 debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault explained his concept of the <i>grille</i>, the particular (historical) circumstances that produce knowledge: each <i>grille</i> has ‘its choices and exclusions; a new play with its own rules, decisions, and limitations.’<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> However, these rules and limitations should not be seen as restricting some kind of full or true expression, since ‘the working of the rules of an understanding can produce in an individual new and unpublished knowledge.’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> Like <i>Madness and Civilization</i> this seems to share a certain attitude with psychoanalytic theory, in particular with the psychoanalytic theory of desire as Foucault describes it above. The problem that Foucault puts forward with the psychoanalytic theory in <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i> is that its conception ‘of the nature and dynamics of the drives’ relies on an incorrect but ‘common representation of power’ which he terms ‘juridico-discursive.’<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> This juridico-discursive representation of power is explained in detail, with some of its key features including the way it is seen as only ‘restrictive’, ‘monotonous’, and ‘doomed always to repeat itself.’<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> Psychoanalytic theory, Foucault argues, still clings to a notion of power with ‘only the force of the negative on its side’ with ‘no condition to produce […] basically anti-energy.’<small><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small> As Dreyfus and Rabinow phrase it, ‘psychoanalysis announced that the connection between sexuality and the law as repression was absolutely universal.’<small><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small> Besides the invocation of a universal, bound to rile Foucault, it’s psychoanalysis’ inability to view the law’s power as anything but repressive, despite formulating a theory that the law ‘constitutes,’<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small> that Foucault is most eager to set himself apart from.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;As with his mixed praise for psychoanalysis’ ‘radical’ theory of desire,<small><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></small> Foucault’s attitude towards psychoanalysis is ambivalent throughout <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i>. In ‘The Deployment of Sexuality’, for example, Foucault suddenly makes a brief but impassioned defence of psychoanalysis’ attitude towards eugenics. In a tone critiquing the self-satisfaction of psychoanalysis’ critics, for whom ‘it is very well to look back from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing impulses in Freud’, Foucault tells us ‘the fact remains that’ psychoanalysis was ‘the one’ institution in the ‘family of technologies of sex’ that ‘rigorously opposed the political and institutional effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system.’<small><a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></small> Freud specifically attacked degeneration theory early in his career,<small><a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></small> and it is due to this break with ‘the neuropsychiatry of degenerescence’, which Foucault calls psychoanalysis’ ‘inception’, that psychoanalysis ‘regarded with suspicion […] power mechanics aimed at controlling and administering the everyday life of sexuality.’<small><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></small> Foucault relates these mechanics to the ‘surge of racism’ in Germany, and thus explains psychoanalysis’ ‘theoretical and practical opposition to fascism.’<small><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></small> But this explanation comes across as explaining away: unlike the previous defensive tone, Foucault coldly states ‘this position of psychoanalysis was tied to a specific historical conjuncture’, specifically an attempt to ground the theory of desire in ‘the trapping of the old order of power.’<small><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a></small> Again, Foucault undermines Freud archaeologically by attributing his opposition to fascism as dependent on the movements of much older historical trajectories. However, credit for Freud can be excavated from this critique too: as I pointed out above, Foucault brings up psychoanalysis’ ‘normalizing impulses,’<small><a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a></small> but does so in a way that seems to satirise the ahistorical impulse in those who make that critique. Many ascribe to Foucault the widespread presumption that ‘psychoanalytic accounts […] inevitably lend themselves to normalization,’<small><a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a></small> due to Foucault’s preoccupation with normalization throughout his career. But the only times he explicitly brings up this critique in <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i> are here and in the opening pages of ‘We “Other Victorians”’. An account of the repressive hypothesis, those opening pages are highly ironic: he grandly speaks of having ‘liberated ourselves from […] an increasing repression’&nbsp;before performing a volte-face and viciously attacking this exact hypothesis for the remainder of the book.<small><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a></small> That it is as part of these ironic pages we find Foucault speaking of how ‘one denounces Freud’s conformism, the normalizing function of psychoanalysis’&nbsp;again casts ambiguity on his true attitude.<small><a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a></small> 
		<br>
		 <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;To conclude, Foucault’s relationship to psychoanalysis remains ambiguous, even in what can be categorised as his most strident and insidious attack, <i>The History of Sexuality Volume One</i>. Foucault was always determined to distance himself from Freud, and it’s not only the veracity of this impulse but the implicit relationship to psychoanalysis within his work that puts that distance in question. What is clear, however, is that while it may be difficult or inappropriate to decisively settle on the opinion of ‘one who writes in order to have no face,’<small><a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a></small> Foucault engaged in a sustained conversation with psychoanalysis throughout his career. Although at times Foucault may have attempted to silence or suppress psychoanalytic tendencies in his work, at other moments the voice of Freud emerges, whether granted acknowledgement or not by Foucault. In this way a conversation does take place: a conversation demanding a critical sensitivity and intensity to match Foucault’s own, a conversation in which Foucault cannot be pinned down, a conversation of central importance to Foucault’s project.<br>
