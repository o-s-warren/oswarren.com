			<p>If <i>L’Avventura</i> is a film about the weight of absence, <i>La Notte</i> is a film about the rattling machinery of a dead life. Both films establish their examination of fundamental apartness with a singularly stylistic first act:
				<i>L’Avventura</i> all barren wasteland and cries carried away into the sea air; <i>La Notte</i> a kind of sterile science-fiction of glass, steel, and hospital scrubs. The opening credits are instructive for how Antonioni will use this
				architecture: a static shot of a city from above, Milan, but as reflected through a descending shot of a skyscraper faced (here rendered as pure utilitarian texture, unremitting and unending). Where the frames of <i>L’Avventura</i> were
				concerned with the presence of emptiness, shots composed as to stretch out into further nothingness, here the compositions mostly keep close to our protagonists for a claustrophobic fullness. Besides Lidia’s excursion into the outskirts of the
				city, any extended ground for the character’s figures is always crowded with detail - the unrelenting (non-)movement in this film doesn’t come from freedom but boredom, and decisions are only possible because they don’t matter. The only motion
				permissible is mechanistic, embittering the deployment of sexuality most painful in the film’s closing moments. When unobstructed reality enters these lives it overwhelms and must be externalised, projected outwards: the girl in the hospital,
				the broken-faced boys who fight with elbows and stare back at Lidia unblinkingly. Valentina understands what the age demands in a recording she has made: ‘So many words I’d rather not hear, but you can’t escape them. You must resign yourself to
				them like the waves when you float on your back in the ocean.’ She plays the tape once, and then erases it.</p>
