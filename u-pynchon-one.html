		<h3>
		<br>Mysterious Consensus: Miraculous Politics in the Margins of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i></h3><br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> is both of and about late sixties Southern California. Thomas Hill Schaub ascribes to the novel ‘the mood then prevailing of a nation on the threshold of substantive transformations’,<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> a mood which manifests a sense of political possibility, ‘a real alternative’ (<i>L49</i> 118), in a variety of registers both thematic and formal. In this chapter I’ll be bringing together various critical readings of the novel and arguing that these different scholarly strands cohere, although in a way which reveals not political possibility but the flaws inherent in the novel’s conception of that possibility. Alongside a series of close readings, I aim to demonstrate the novel’s consistent reiteration of hopefulness, liminality, and millenarianism, all qualities which will prove problematic when considered from a later, more critical perspective.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the earliest and most famous scholarly articles on Pynchon’s work, immediately recognised as ‘clearly the best thing available on <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>’<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> and referenced in Pynchon criticism to the present day,<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> Edward Mendelson argues that the novel’s ‘processes […] create community’.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> Although Mendelson is right, the statement isn’t indicative of the direction his essay takes, with its primary focus on religion and transcendence, and the novel’s communities remain unexplored. Taking Mendelson’s comment as a starting point, however, Paula Martín Salván distinguishes between two kinds of communities, those ‘institutionalized communal structures’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> that correspond to Louis Althusser’s Ideological State Apparatuses and those ‘other forms of collectivity […] opposed or alternative to officially sanctioned institutions’.<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> Salván regards Oedipa’s task as ‘becoming incorporated in some kind of “we”’.<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> This attempt, after Salván establishes that Oedipa ‘rejects becoming part of ISAs’,<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> follows the same trajectory as that Joanna Freer describes: a ‘strain towards […] liminal, anti-structural spaces and marginal associations in order to achieve what the anthropologist Victor Turner described as <i>communitas</i>’.<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> The term refers to a community that ‘emerges where social structure is not’<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small>: communitas is ‘spontaneous, immediate, concrete’.<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small>&nbsp;Communication and shared experience is key, and Salván reminds us that ‘above all, the Trystero is a mechanism to exchange messages in situations where physical contact is not possible’.<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Accordingly, the ‘proliferation of countercultures’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> in the novel are linked under the ‘muted post horn’ (<i>L49</i> 75) of Tristero, a signifier of alternative communication.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Pynchon’s thematising of community and communication through those associated with Tristero is consistently utopian: witness Golden Gate Park’s ‘circle of children’ (<i>L49</i> 81), playing ‘a jump-rope game’ (<i>L49</i> 82) on a chalk post horn, requiring ‘nothing but their own unpenetrated sense of community’ in order to empty the night ‘of all terror’ (<i>L49</i> 82). Schaub associates Tristero with ‘the communion of withdrawal’,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> yet moments of idealistic consensus can be found wherever the mainstream is rejected: Mucho Maas’ LSD infused ‘vision of consensus’ (<i>L49</i> 99) at the KCUF mobile radio unit for example, or the American Deaf-Mute Assembly’s ballroom dance in which nobody collides and all simultaneously break ‘by mysterious consensus’ (<i>L49</i> 91). Jesús Arrabal of the ‘Conjuración de los Insurgentes Anarquistas’ (<i>L49</i> 82), or C.I.A. for short, opines about ‘another world’ in which ‘revolutions break out spontaneous and leaderless, and the soul’s talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort’ (<i>L49</i> 83): the underground communities and mystical consensuses Pynchon presents argue for the possibility of such an ‘anarchist miracle’ (<i>L49</i> 83). Throughout <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, Pynchon underscores a consistent belief in the power (and beauty) of specifically marginal communities to potentially manifest miraculous communication. It’s been postulated by John Dugdale that Pynchon’s novels ‘contain political messages which he is unwilling to communicate directly’,<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> framing Pynchon’s novels as marginal communications themselves. Dugdale’s notion of indirect communication lies behind much of Pynchon scholarship: Schaub argues that a ‘quality of insinuation, a textual paranoia induced within and energizing the reader, constitutes the affective politics’ of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Although this relationship between expression and form instigates a implicitly political mode of reading, it will also contribute to the novel’s political weakness.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of Pynchon’s praise in <i>Slow Learner</i>’s introduction for the ‘exciting, liberating’ Beat Generation authors he read as a student is the way in which their ‘subversive’ language could ‘coexist’ with other forms of fiction: ‘not a case of either/or, but an expansion of possibilities’.<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> Freer argues that Pynchon’s novels are ‘innately anti-authoritarian’ since they ‘encourage independent critical speculation or investigation […] by a reader acting with relative autonomy’,<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> imbuing his texts with similarly expansive possibilities. The extent to which this open hermeneutical challenge has been taken up can be seen in scholarship such as Charles Hollander’s 1997 article ‘Pynchon, JFK and the CIA’, in which Hollander reads <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>as ‘Pynchon’s encrypted meditation on the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy’.<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> Hollander, through tracing and analysing the proliferation of proper nouns both fictional and historical, argues for the presence of ‘a lot more than the overt narrative’ within the novel.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> In doing so he lives up to Anette Kolodny and Daniel James Peters’ early characterisation of reading Pynchon as ‘a subversive experience’,<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> in which we are trained in ‘the denial of “either/or” construction’ to see ‘the realities beyond the appearance’.<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> In an article predating <i>Vineland</i>’s publication, Hollander used this double aspect of Pynchon’s prose to argue that ‘Pynchon’s politics are absent, or in deep code’,<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> yet I would argue that this misses the liminality of Pynchon’s political expressions. Pynchon’s politics are not hidden or absent, but preoccupied in <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> with a transitory state: what is significant is what is about to happen, and thus any concrete political expression must be deferred. Noting ‘the reproduction of several of Freud’s images […] juxtaposed with the appearance of analyst or doctor figures’ in the novel’s content, Dugdale also recognises a formal ‘division of manifest and latent structure […] with <i>allusions</i>, as in Freud, providing the link between the two’.<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Such a structure gestures towards the political ramifications of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>: as opposed to a dry didacticism, Pynchon invests the novel with possibility in open-ended allusions designed to energise the reader into creative interpretation. This places the meaning of the novel in a liminal position, with the text as a springboard rather than an end in itself. Disguising itself as a code to be cracked or question to be solved, the novel instead instigates motion and intellectual creativity. The novel famously ends with ‘Oedipa settled back, to await the crying of lot 49’ (<i>L49</i> 127), still totally unable to distinguish between ‘a true paranoia, or a real Tristero’ (<i>L49</i> 126). Yet, as Freer argues, ‘Oedipa is freer than before, her day is more open to unexpected intrusions’<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small>: in accordance with Freer’s argument, Oedipa is described at the end as lamenting her earlier obliviousness, wondering at the possibilities she previously would have found ‘[i]f only she’d looked’ (<i>L49 </i>124). The implication is that from now on she’ll be looking, and her alignment as a reader, beginning ‘her quest at a Jacobean play’ and concluding it ‘reading old books in libraries’,<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> suggests we will be too. Kolodny and Peters write that ‘the notion of Tristero implies the acceptance of things beyond the limits’,<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> and <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> has an implicit formal faith in the possibility of doing so: in constantly referring beyond itself to the obscure paraphernalia of a proliferation of intellectual and cultural fields it resolutely pushes the reader to alternative horizons beyond the limits of the text itself. There’s another level the text manifests this too, as ‘hierophany’ (<i>L49</i> 20): Mircea Eliade’s term for the ‘manifestation of the sacred in some ordinary object’, the emerging of ‘a reality that does not belong to our world, in objects that are an integral part of our natural “profane” world’.<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> Pynchon’s use of the obscure term signals a theme running throughout the novel, that of political millenarianism.
		&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel’s most significant millenarian image is its title. As Cyrus Patell points out, the word ‘Pentecost’, derived etymologically from the Greek for ‘fiftieth’, is ‘linked to both revelation and the ability to communicate’ in Greek and Jewish traditions’.<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> The word’s appearance in the novel (<i>L49</i> 45) suggests for Patell that ‘Lot 49 symbolically represents the moment before revelation, the threshold that must be crossed to move from babble to communication’.<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> Although Patell pessimistically concludes that the novel’s ‘characters and its readers never cross over into revelation’,<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> I would argue that his reading merely underlines the novel’s millenarian nature which is, by definition, expectant of a new and radical existence. Revelation is everywhere: Oedipa finds herself in ‘an odd, religious instant’ (<i>L49 </i>15) at one moment and surrounded by ‘hieratic geometry’ (<i>L49 </i>37) the next. Frank Palmeri points out that each of the novel’s religious references are ‘revelations quivering on the horizon’ which ‘continue to do just that’<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small>; early in the novel we are told Oedipa will ‘have all manner of revelations’ (<i>L49 </i>12), yet by the novel’s end they still are yet to come. Such certainty in imminent change becomes its opposite, however, with the novel’s millenarian language framing the possibility of politics within the logic of revelation and thereby divorcing it from action: if radical politics occurs as some variation of an ‘anarchist miracle’ (<i>L49</i> 83), then it will happen in a spontaneous and mystical way.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean McCann and Michael Szalay identify mysticism, in which ‘complaints against science and rationality became increasingly common, and invocations of the irrational and mysterious took on newfound authority’, as the primary result of sixties political counterculture.<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> McCann and Szalay accuse politically-committed ‘American writers in the decades following the sixties’ of ‘withdrawing […] from the very possibility of orchestrated change’ in their pursuit of ‘an ostensibly higher politics’, deriding ‘progress, enlightenment, and reason’ and revering ‘the unknowable force of mystery’.<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> If such religiosity and reverence for the irrationally spontaneous is understood an ‘ultimately comforting folklore’ that replaces practical action,<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> then it is significant that the novel aligns Oedipa’s rationalising of what she sees with the ‘ecstasy of a true paranoia’ (<i>L49</i> 126). The adjective ‘true’ here can be read in two ways: as a complete and inexorable paranoia, or as a paranoia that is correct in its fear. Paranoid conspiracy theory is one of the key registers of the novel, yet Pynchon refuses to disavow paranoia as false and delusional, presenting it instead as radical and transcendental. For ‘the true paranoid’, associated with ‘the clairvoyant’, performs ‘a thrust at truth and a lie’ (<i>L49</i> 89). Fredric Jameson explicates a far more pessimistic sense of how conspiracy theory is in a sense truthful: he defines it as ‘the poor person’s cognitive mapping in the postmodern age’, as ‘a degraded figure of the total logic of late capital, a desperate attempt to represent the latter’s system’.<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> The conspiracy theory is an attempt ‘to think a system so vast that it cannot be encompassed by […] categories of perception with which human beings normally orient themselves’.<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small>&nbsp;Thus, Pynchon’s use of the rhetoric of conspiracy theory in fact, against he and his characters’ forward-looking hopefulness, exposes the world as far more abstract and sinister than the novel’s utopian mood suggests. Celebrations of millenarian certainty and irrational paranoia are merely reactions to a political situation becoming incomprehensible. As a result, the abundant political possibility of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> is made incredibly fragile, dependent on the assumption that something of a miraculous nature is about to happen. As <i>Vineland</i> shows twenty-four years later, the miracle never came.<br>
