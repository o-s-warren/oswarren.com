		Perhaps equally famous both for its reality, as what is widely considered the first documentary, and for its unreality. <i>Nanook of the North</i> follows Nanook (actually named Allakariallak) and his family for eighty minutes, and through them depicts various aspects of life: hunting, dwelling, trading, and being together. Much of the film was staged, with director Robert Flaherty asking Allakariallak and the others (not his actual family members in many cases) not to depict Inuit life as they lived it in the early 1920s but as they would have done before the European colonisation of the America. This meant ditching their partially Western-derived clothes and their rifles, and, in one particularly egregious scene, affecting a childlike naivety in misunderstanding and biting a gramophone record (which they would have had experience with and understood). 
		</p><br><p>
		To critique the film on these ground, though, surely misses the mark: it’s not 1922 reality being depicted in this proto-documentary, but what was already a kind of historical re-enactment, or a fictional feature that draws on the resources of non-fiction in a particularly innovative way. Flaherty’s aim, after meeting with and learning about the people of the Hudson Bay over many years, was to attempt to preserve practices already mostly phased out, while the Inuit cast (and crew, for Flaherty employed locals to operate the equipment which he himself had only learnt a few years earlier at a three-week New York cinematography course) still retained a deep familiarity with the ways of their ancestors.
		</p><br><p>
		Yet, this self-conscious motive is what creates documentary as a fledgling genre. Part of the magic of this film is in the wonder it produces in seeing these practices: situating them within their geographical source, and having them carried out by the community to which these practices were historically so important, is an undeniably powerful thing. That each night Flaherty would screen the day’s footage for the films participants and incorporate their subsequent suggestions is relevant, too, in its indication that this document of an already historical way of life was a collaborative production. 
		</p><br><p>
		That such a project exists this early in the history of cinema makes it particularly remarkable. The film is obsessed with depicting craft and technique, and that attention seeps into the film’s technical processes. For Flaherty is shaping reality according to an astute understanding of the technical and conceptual capabilities of the still young medium, and that the film works so well as a feature expresses a sophisticated reckoning with the way in which an artist moulds reality into a particular kind of truth. The film takes the originary impulses of cinema, seen in the shorts of the Lumière brothers, and combines them with the subsequently accumulated processes of creating an artistically convincing filmic reality. The tenderness with which the young boy plays with a snow fox, the open smile of Allakariallak, the harshness of the icy wind and the fur of the dogs matted with snow - these moments are profoundly truthful within the non-fictional creation that is <i>Nanook of the North</i>.
