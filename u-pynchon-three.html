		<h3>
		<br>The Wrong State of Things: Pynchon, Adorno, and Utopian Pessimism</h3><br>
		
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trajectory from <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> to <i>Vineland</i> now plotted out, the intensity of Pynchon’s pessimism appears to annul all hope. In a discussion with Max Horkheimer regarding an updated communist manifesto, Theodor Adorno stated that ‘[w]e do not live in a revolutionary situation, and actually things are worse than ever’.<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> <i>Vineland</i> follows those who had ‘to go on living’ (<i>VL</i> 42) after the sixties’ moment of possibility was missed. Adorno begins <i>Negative Dialectics</i> by stating ‘[p]hilosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed’, that ‘the attempt to change the world miscarried’.<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small>&nbsp;Weed Atman attempts to continue ‘preaching humane revolution’ despite the fact he’s ‘darkly exhausted, unhopeful’; Pynchon tells us that even ‘[i]f anybody caught this change, it was much too late to make a difference’ (<i>VL </i>229). Edward Said determines Adorno to be ‘a figure of lateness itself, an untimely, scandalous, even catastrophic commentator on the present’.<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> Adorno has a strained relation to the sixties: Adrian Wilding documents his alienation from ‘the student radicals of the late 1960s who mocked his political aloofness and ridiculed him in ways which probably contributed to his fatal heart attack’,<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> with Adorno explicitly warning in his lectures to these students of ‘a great danger of what might be termed an illicit shortcut to practical action’.<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> But, by the time of <i>Vineland</i>, Pynchon’s vision of the sixties has taken on a quality reminiscent of Adorno’s warnings at the time. Adorno is not a theorist in the sense of other theorists I have turned to so far: as Ross Wilson warns, ‘Adorno’s work does not provide any easily recognisable method for approaching artworks’, ‘some set of criteria […] that would add up to a “literary theory”’.<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> In this chapter, then, I will not so much be offering an Adornian reading of Pynchon, but postulating an Adornian Pynchon: in which ways do the coordinates of Adorno’s ‘melancholy science’ map on to Pynchon’s writing,<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> and to what extent do the two novels accord with Adorno’s insistence on revealing the world ‘as indigent and distorted as it will appear one day in the messianic light’?<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small><b>&nbsp;</b><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foundation of Adorno’s aesthetics is a warning against the commodification of culture: ‘For him who has a genuine relation to art, in which he himself vanishes, art is not an object’ for ‘devouring’, for which ‘a balance sheet could be drawn up’.<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small>&nbsp;Pynchon documents a similar process in <i>Vineland</i>, set in a world Judith Chambers describes as ‘irrefragably reduced to commodity and surface’.<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> In <i>Vineland</i> it is not just ‘revolution’ that starts ‘blending into commerce’ (<i>VL</i> 308) but culture too, as was documented extensively in chapter two. Adorno’s concept of the culture industry expands upon the function of not just the co-option of counterculture Fredric Jameson identifies, but the commodification of all culture. Mucho Maas admits ‘rock and roll is becoming’ a way to ‘keep us distracted’ (<i>VL</i> 314), echoing Adorno and Horkheimer’s argument that ‘culture, art and distraction, are subordinated to one end and subsumed under one false formula: the totality of the culture industry’.<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> The culture industry, demonstrated symptomatically by <i>Vineland</i>’s commodity culture, is both antagonistic to critical thought and replaces judgementwith the false pleasure of mere recognition: ‘the critical spirit is as disturbing as sand in a machine to that smoothly-running operation’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small>; ‘[t]he familiarity of the piece is a surrogate for the quality ascribed to it’.<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> <i>Vineland</i>’s mimesis of a culture saturated with television, then, is connected through Adorno to the novel’s political diagnosis.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Chapter Two’s discussion of Žižek and interpassivity can also be expanded upon by the concept: Adorno describes how the Culture Industry ‘removes [the cultural product] from the realm of genuine spontaneity by predetermining its character’.<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small>&nbsp;Thus, the cultural product is ‘pre-digested […] baby-food’, satisfying an ‘infantile compulsion […] it creates in the first place’.<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> The television convinces you of your desire to laugh, shapes its product in a way in which the moment of laughter is strictly prescribed, then, through its interpassive canned laughter, laughs for you anyway. Even the spiritual Sisterhood of Kunoichi Attentives, a community whom Samuel Thomas identifies as the source of radical possibility in the novel in an argument that fails to take account of the pessimistic shift between <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> and <i>Vineland</i>,<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> are enmeshed problematically in commerce. The Sisterhood used to let people ‘crash […] for free’, but ‘now it’s group insurance, pension plans, financial consultant name of Vicki down in L.A. who moves it all around for us’ (<i>VL</i> 128). As Thomas himself admits, ‘there is something rather unsettling about the claim that the 27 acres of Big Sur coastline it occupies were once home to a Native American tribe’,<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> with Pynchon explicitly connecting the Sisterhood’s cooption into commercialism with the violent domination that the Culture Industry serves to uphold.<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In ‘Commitment’, Adorno insists that art, rather than become complicit in the workings of the culture industry by functioning as an object of consumption, must resist ‘the course of the world’.<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> There are two ways in which ‘Commitment’ can inform a reading of Pynchon: its rejection of the possibility of realism, and its rejection of politically didactic committed art. <i>Minima Moralia</i> describes a ‘world that has turned abstract’,<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> a world ‘indigent and distorted’.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> Apparent realism merely maintains the false ideology of the world, for ‘political truth’ now ‘involves innumerable mediations’.<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> As Simon Jarvis elucidates, Adorno finds in Beckett and Kafka an appropriate ‘kind of mimesis’, a ‘mimesis of the systematic framework which impoverishes experience’<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small>: when, as <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> suggests, ‘only what does not fit into this world is true’,<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> then a mimetic relation to that false world should not be prioritized. Pynchon’s works clearly include fantastical elements, but <i>Vineland</i> also rejects realism on a thematic level. Frenesi’s radical film collective 24fps, and their belief ‘in the ability of close-ups to reveal and devastate’ (<i>VL</i>195), are symbolic of the impossibility of true objectivity, ‘a standpoint removed’ from ‘distortion and indigence’.<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Simon Malpas and Andrew Taylor convincingly argue that ‘Brock’s own appearance on film, as shot by Frenesi, suggests the artificially constructed nature of his self-image’, his eccentric outfit signifying ‘a countercultural avant-garde with which Vond has no sympathy’.<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> Brock Vond’s eventual manipulation of the 24fps productions, ‘seeing the outtakes’ and ‘making suggestions about what to shoot’ (<i>VL</i> 209), both mocks a naïve trust that truth can be objectively captured, and a concrete representation of how, for Adorno and Horkheimer, ‘even so far as men have not yet succumbed to political delusion, the mechanisms of censorship – both internal and external – will deprive them of the means of resistance’.<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> In contrast, one of the novel’s most hopeful moments affirms the inevitability of mediation. In the eighties, Prairie views the 24fps archives and feels ‘the liberation in the place […] the faith that anything was possible’, having ‘never seen anything like it before’: it is ‘through the crude old color and distorted sound’ that Prairie experiences hope, hope inextricably mingled with a temporal and mediated distance from any supposed reality she witnesses (<i>VL</i> 210).<br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;An acknowledgement of the inevitability of mediation informs Adorno’s rejection of committed art, art created for the express purpose of conveying a political or philosophical message. Adorno believes that ‘[a]rtworks that unfold to contemplation and thought without any remainder are not artworks’,<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> and so committed works are ‘degraded to a clattering machinery for the demonstration of worldviews’.<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> As David Cowart accurately points out, Pynchon ‘leaves his readers in no doubt regarding his attitude towards racism, oppressive economic practices, genocidal violence, skullduggery in high places, and police-state repression’. Does Pynchon’s ‘profound empathy with what he calls the preterite, the left out’ contradict his art’s power to resist?<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> While Adorno famously criticised Sartre and Brecht, he distinguishes ‘commitment’ from ‘tendency’,<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> and makes clear that what remains powerful in Brecht is ‘saturated in politics’.<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> Political art is not an oxymoron, but art that reduces itself to a didactic political motive is. As my earlier discussion of reader interpretation and <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> makes clear, Pynchon’s politics are far from didactic. Furthermore, his novels are clearly irreducible to politics alone: it’s for this reason that politically-focused scholarship has only ‘recently begun to gain ascendancy over thematic analyses of the author’s work or considerations of its self-reflexively postmodern attributes’.<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> Such irreducibility justifies my attempt to chart an Adornian Pynchon, despite Adorno’s own claims that ‘[a]pplied philosophy’ is ‘fatal’ to works of art<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small>: as Martin Eve puts it, ‘we need not be overly worried about critically dominating Pynchon’s work; his texts are more than capable of fighting back’.<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The irreducible and autonomous nature of art is where the utopian aspect of Adorno’s pessimism emerges. Art’s ‘situation is one of paradox’<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small>: it ‘is the social antithesis of society’.<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> Ross Wilson explicates this definition by aligning it with <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>’s later statement that ‘artworks are only able to become other than thing by becoming a thing’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small>: art must ‘exist’ in order to ‘criticize existing reality’ and so ‘art’s critical aspect relies on its being like what it criticizes’. At the same time, ‘autonomous art is emancipated from having to perform any specific, pre-established social role’, therefore existing ‘in contradiction to a society in which everything must be exchangeable for everything else’, as a ‘negation of existing society’.<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> The resulting paradoxical, pessimistic situation of the artist is summarized in Adorno’s <i>Philosophy of New Music</i>: ‘No artist is able on his own to transcend the contradiction between unchained art and enchained society’. Instead, what the artist does, ‘perhaps on the verge of despair, is contradict the enchained society through unchained art’.<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> This contradictory negation is also, for Adorno, the only form in which utopia can be addressed.<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> Citing a previously untranslated essay, Deborah Cook defends the philosopher from frequent criticisms of ‘failing to provide a blueprint for radical social change’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small>: Adorno understands that we ‘may not know what people are and what the correct arrangement of human affairs should be, but we do know what people should not be and what arrangement of human affairs is false’. For Adorno, this critically negative understanding is the only available way in which to experience ‘the other, positive, one’.<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small><br>
		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Pynchon, in the the pessimistic reinterpretation of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>’s radical movement through the lens of <i>Vineland</i>, performs a similar move. In <i>Slow Learner</i>’s introduction, Pynchon emphasises&nbsp;the ‘impotence’ of ‘writing fiction’.<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> However, Stephen doCarmo identifies that ‘Pynchon insists on struggle, and he also concedes a type of defeat’:<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> it’s for this reason that Johnny Copeland sings, in <i>Vineland</i>’s epigraph, ‘[e]very dog has his day, / and a good dog / just might have two days’. <i>Vineland</i>understands, ‘as betrayal became routine’, that the hopes of the sixties ‘may only in some fading memories ever have been a people’s miracle’ (<i>VL</i> 239). Pynchon’s critical view of the sixties is expressed most damningly in his mocking of the complacent radicals’ blissful memories. Zoyd recollects <br></p>
		
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>the Mellow Sixties […] as a soft-focus shot, the kind to be seen on “sensitivity” greeting cards. Everything in nature, every living being […] was gentle, at peace […] War in Vietnam, murder as an instrument of American politics, black neighborhoods torched to ashes and death, all must have been off on some other planet.</p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Pynchon immediately undercuts Zoyd’s memory as shaped by the culture industry, his thinking within a framework of commercial greeting cards and television clichés, but the significant critical move comes in the sharp and sudden contrast between ‘gentle […] peace’ and the realities of imperialism, state repression, and racism. Zoyd’s denial of these issues signals Pynchon’s strategy throughout the novel: to persistently reveal the inescapable totality of injustice and complicity in even those places presumed safe, including thought and memory. Malpas and Taylor call this a ‘politically aware nostalgia’, in which ‘the past’s repetitive and lingering presence […] does not generate its affective force through a desired return to pastoral wholeness’.<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> The link to Adorno is clear, who believes the ‘gesture of the unthinking That’s-how-it-is is the exact means by which the world dispatches each of its victims’,<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> and advocates deeply attentive critical perspectives ‘that displace and estrange the world’.<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> Cherished memories of a supposedly utopian past can motivate, but should be understood as both impossible fictions and expressions of hope. Martin Paul Eve argues that ‘Pynchon’s novels enact a mournful nostalgia for a regulative utopian state’ that is not an uncritically considered ‘lost, past situation […] but rather a hope for that which does not exist’.<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> <i>Vineland </i>understands that to conceive of utopia is simultaneously ‘the simplest of all things, because the situation calls imperatively for such knowledge […] But it is also the utterly impossible thing’<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small>: instead of offering a blueprint for social change it nostalgically gestures towards an inexpressible utopia which did not and may never exist.<br>
		
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Vineland</i>, Pynchon’s pessimism seems overwhelming, yet, when considered as a thematic sequel to <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, demonstrates that pessimism as both essential and necessary. In <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> it seemed possible to ‘project a world’ (<i>L49</i>56), but after the failure of the sixties to manifest radical change, after the Culture Industry has shaped even what it is possible to think, Pynchon’s task is to express by negation the right state of things through sufficient attention to ‘the wrong state of things’.<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> To conclude this chapter, then, I’d like to return to my reading of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>. I’ve aligned the content of Pynchon’s novels to Adorno’s theories regarding total society and political possibility, to reveal Pynchon as engaging in what Adorno argues is the only available, contradiction-ridden, course of action: to hold out hope for what is hopeless, while engaging in a critical project to expose the wrongness of society in order to attain a negative glimpse at its inconceivable opposite. But Adorno argues, as I explored earlier, that art is radical in its mere autonomous existence, as both of and unlike existing society. Pynchon encourages critical readers, demanding a subversive and creative reading; such a thought process, required in both <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> and <i>Vineland</i>, evokes a kind of Adornian non-identity thinking. The artworks Pynchon presents refuse to be dominated under the identity of a single concept. They instead require, to borrow Adorno’s phrasing, a constellation that ‘illuminates the specific’,<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> a mode of thinking which resists ‘identity’s claim to be total’ and ‘circles the concept it would like to unseal’.<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small>&nbsp;As Alison Stone explicates, the Adornian constellation ‘does not give us conceptual <i>understanding</i> of a thing in its uniqueness’ but ‘<i>resembles</i> this unique thing’ by maintaining its ‘opacity’,<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> an ‘acknowledgement that things cannot be fully understood in conceptual terms’.<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> Identity thinking is the concept’s ‘domination’ of the ‘particular’<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><small>[55]</small>;</a> Pynchon stifles this impulse with his vast, irreducible works of fiction.<br>
