			<p>For the vast majority of the past two decades, Anne Ryan exhibited quietly brooding easel paintings of terse figures, remote and preoccupied. The inhabitants of Ryan’s current show at Hastings Contemporary are, like the characters of the Bosch
				triptych from which it nabs its name, marvellously self-absorbed but absolutely captivating; the hysterical enthusiasm with which the figures carry out their individual weirdnesses is contagious as you wander around and among them. Eight MDF
				tables stand in a single room; on each table are between three and six jagged card cut-outs, a mixture of craggy abstract shapes and silhouetted outlines of semi-distinguishable figures. The surfaces on each side of each cut-out are populated
				with a jumble of additional painted characters, falling about themselves around washes of colour, stuck-on pieces of thick card and canvas along with occasional collaged printed material. The figures are sketches in the best sense, all flowing
				contours and excitable restatements, as if having stumbled off the easel of a life drawing class before knocking a few pots of paint over on their way into the gallery.</p>
		
			<br>
		
			<p>Although the cutouts do have individual titles, ranging from evocatively direct (‘Two Women Supporting Another’) to playful and descriptive (‘Disco Legs’), the works here are gathered under a single title: <i>Earthly Delites</i>, an old
				English variation on the Bosch. The individual cutouts do seem internally consistent in their types of mess: ‘Parading in the City’ could be cut from the canvas of a bustling Renoir with its shimmering silhouetted gentlemen, whereas others take
				on the washy luminescence of a sorrowful Charlotte Salomon gouache or the boisterous layered textiles of a Tschabalala Self portrait. These pieces resist isolation, though; the torn negative spaces of each are counterbalanced by a vibrant
				backdrop made up of the other partygoers, framing and playing off each other incessantly. ‘I want to involve people in my paintings,’ Ryan tells us in the brief single wall text; wandering through the space immerses one in the clamour, involves
				you in a scene of total involvement: these figures are involved with each other in all sorts of ways (dancing, scrapping, squabbling), and each mini chaos seems to bounce off and reverberate with the slightly differing jumble of its table-mates
				to produce a cacophonous pandemonium.</p>

			<p>Many of Ryan’s previous exhibitions roamed through the moribund theatricality of the Western genre, that now ghostly document of twentieth-century masculinity. In these and Ryan’s many other exhibitions since 1999, there were always thematic
				and stylistic consistencies: homosocial groupings and gendered spaces, the appropriation of film stills and pulp covers, a lightly built layering of oil stain in scratchy browns and ethereal greys. This was painting that pushed back, opaque and
				cryptic. Then, in the 2016 group show March Mostra, Ryan kicked through the frosted-glass window with her first cutouts. Brightness and range of colour, varied paint textures and collaged relief, quantity, mood, the fact that these five-sided
				things were no longer even on the wall but all over the gallery floor; this work crashed out of nowhere and seemed entirely unlike what preceded it. The shift, although that seems a verb for a movement far easier to follow, happened during a
				residency in Rome when Ryan began using the card on the back of her sketching pads as she traced the writhing Baroque of the Trevi Fountain throng. Back in the studio, she cut them up into three dimensional constructions, and followed the lead
				of their silhouettes to fill in their backs with a further cast of creatures. The cutouts are positively buzzing with with energy, wide open arms and cartweeling legs.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So why this sudden lurch? Ryan speaks in interviews of following the lead of process rather than any pre-determined composition. This tendency existed in her earliest work, re-exhibited at Turps Gallery in 2017 as <i>The Cowboy Paintings</i>;
				although she worked from appropriated images, she would often make significant compositional changes such as adding and subtracting figures well into the painting’s making. In fact, on the top floor of Hastings Contemporary Ryan has curated
				<i>The Studio at 4 A.M.</i>, a showcase of work by eight contemporary artists themed around that flowing, focused stream of total absorption in thinking-through-making. It really seems that Ryan caught hold of an attitude particularly vibrant
				and dynamic, and then followed through with her intuition. The work on show in Hastings Contemporary has the quality of that early-morning frenzy, constantly making and remaking through a felt idea, grabbing the loose threads that emerge and
				unravelling them into spools of energy and inspiration. And this quantity is something of what makes the show so great; navigating the space keeps throwing up fresh new spectacles of excessive colour and character. The exhibition is about and
				offers wide-eyed discovery, raucous plenty grabbing your attention in ten different directions as part of an ever-shifting bustle. Go along with it, and catch your breath later.</p>
