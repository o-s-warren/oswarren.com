		  Love in Barthes, Loving Barthes: Affect and <i>A Lover's Discourse</i>
		</h3>
		<br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		  &nbsp; &nbsp; What we talk about when we talk about love is by no means clear. Love can be read as an affect, an affective state, as a term which signifies particular moods, emotions, or intentions, and as a conceptual ideal that informs or deforms our relations and ways of being. For the purposes of this essay I will be treating love as the phenomenon which produces a particular figure: the lover. This essay posits that love is useful for thinking about affect, for thinking about affect is what the lover does. The lover, in a frenzy of thought and desire, experiences and speaks a rich repertoire of discourse through which to consider affect and the nature of various affects. After outlining the position of love within affect theory, through readings of the foundational figure Silvan Tomkins alongside contemporary theorists Sara Ahmed and Lauren Berlant, this essay will transition into an exploratory reading of Barthes’ <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>: a text I will argue offers a unique formal appropriateness to an attempt to understand love and love’s affects. This central section of the essay will follow some of the key contours found in affect theory, moving from sensation to epistemology, then from the lover’s relationship with the world to the lover’s political implications. The essay will conclude by thinking about love and reading alongside love and writing, and reflect on Barthes’ text as a space where love is.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; In his monumental <i>Affect Imagery Consciousness</i>, Silvan Tomkins uses love as a general term to cover the positive affects, with ‘love’ standing in for ‘the magic of excitement and joy’ whilst ‘hate’ represents ‘the dread of fear, shame, or distress.’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> Elsewhere in the text, the term seems to take on its own independent existence as an affect, such as when Tomkins lists the ‘varied positive affects: joy, excitement, love of people, of places, of activities, and of things.’<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</small>Tomkins’ nine affects are concrete and qualitatively distinct: despite the slippage, it’s clear that love is not itself an affect but a concept with which to think about the direction and intentionality of the positive affects (as signified by the way Tomkins’ love is a love <i>of</i> particular ‘things’. One of the few moments when Tomkins theorises love is his explanation that in ‘romantic love […] the other is idealised as exemplifying the most excitement and joy-worthiness.’<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> Tomkins provides this definition only as an aside, however, during a detailed discussion on what he calls romantic hate. That Tomkins glosses romantic love only in order to explain the more idiosyncratic idea of romantic hate is indicative of the way in which he takes love itself as a stable concept. Love, Tomkins later suggests, is a state in which an object can be ‘regarded as having a monopoly on many, if not all, good […] qualities.’ Again, Tomkins mentions this significant formal quality – the way love causes subjects to invest particular objects with purely positive affect – only as an aside to a discussion of how romantic hate involves hatred not only of the ‘difference’ of the ‘hated minority’ but of its ‘attempts at assimilation.’<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> That Tomkins discusses love in relation not only to hate but to oppressive investments leads us into more contemporary affect theory, specifically Sara Ahmed’s <i>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</i>.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Ahmed’s differing focus on the politics of emotion are made explicit in her comments on <i>Affect Imagery Consciousness</i>. Ahmed finds Tomkins’ work ‘useful at the level of description probably because his descriptions push against his own model,’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> with the aspects of Tomkins’ theory most objectionable to her being ‘his model of affect as a universal and biological program that […] can function independently,’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> and the way in which his ‘attention to affect as opposed to drive emphasises the “freedom” of emotion from specific objects.’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> Rather than the potential freedom of affect investments, Ahmed demonstrates the ways in which affect is entangled with normativity, something which Tomkins’ examples implicitly reveal: in <i>Affect Imagery Consciousness</i> ‘we end up with a set of descriptions of the techniques for differentiating between classes of beings in terms of how they enable or threaten individual or social welfare and wellbeing.’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> The link Ahmed implicitly makes here between affective investments and oppression refers not only to hatred; in<i> The Cultural Politics of Emotion</i>, structures of oppression are linked with both negative and positive affects, including love. This proceeds from her particular understanding of emotions as ‘not simply “in” the subject or the object’; rather, ‘objects are often read as the cause of emotions in the very process of taking an orientation towards them.’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> For that reason, Ahmed’s ‘concern is not to define “what is love,”’ but ‘to consider how the pull of love towards an other, who becomes an object of love, can be transferred towards a collective.’<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><small>[10]</small></a> Ahmed sketches out a schema in which ‘love does not pre-exist identification’ instead, ‘forms of identification that align this subject with this other’ produce ‘the <i>character</i> of the loved,’ while also implicitly aligning the subject ‘against other others’ to ‘produce the character of the hated.’<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> In other words, that which is loved is presumed to be loved because it is lovable; the agency of the subject’s affective encounters in its object investment is disavowed. Using this conceptual apparatus, Ahmed moves in the rest of the text to consider the way love, as a term and as a concept, is put to use politically. For example, when ‘hate groups […] declare themselves as organisations of love on their web sites,’ as they often do, the very term ‘does an enormous amount of work as a form of justification and persuasion.’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Ahmed also closely reads George W. Bush’s 2002 State of the Union Address and argues that in it ‘the role of citizen as police is translated as an imperative to love,’ in which the use of the term ‘involves the defence of particular institutional and social forms against the danger posed by others.’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> For Ahmed, ‘love is crucial to how individuals become aligned with collectives through their identification with an ideal, an alignment that relies on the existence of others who have failed that ideal.’<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> Love as a term is a tool used by political collectives to foster hatred, and a concept which covers its own tracks in ‘producing a particular kind of subject whose allegiance to [an] ideal makes it an ideal in the first place.’<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> Ahmed’s problematising of love, exploring how the concept can function oppressively in the service of normative ideals, can be further extended by turning to Lauren Berlant’s discussion of the formal contradictions expected of love.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; While Tomkins treats love as a stable concept that does not require detailed explication, and Ahmed complicates our understanding of love as a force of social good, Berlant explores how our contradictory expectations of love create a concept of heightened formal complexity: for ‘even if its content is unclear, love’s function is to be formally brilliant.’<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small>&nbsp;Love’s form for Berlant is about repetition and ‘the problem it realises of uniqueness and convention.’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> For love demands both particularity (the love one feels must be uniquely specific, authentic and original) and universality (one’s love must fit into an available template of love in order to be recognised). Berlant claims that an ‘impossible continuity’ is demanded between ‘the uniqueness and conventionality of love,’<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> and also contends that this ‘incoherent logic has had to be romanticized, noticed and disavowed, and aestheticized, as in the concept of <i>crazy love</i>.’<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> What makes this so formally demanding is the way in which ‘the ideology of modern love has it that these impersonal structures of repetition’ – the formal qualities of a feeling or affective state that align it recognisably with the concept of love – ‘are themselves pathologies that threaten the true uniqueness of one’s expressive relation.’<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> Another crucial formal complexity of love that Berlant uncovers is ‘the lover’s production of a sort of epistemic frenzy, a drive towards and aversion to knowledge.’<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> Love makes us insecure about our interpretations for, as Berlant points out in a later essay, ‘the anxiety to define […] especially cleaves to love.’<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> This self-consciousness, and the lover’s determination to pick up on and analyse feelings that could otherwise be dismissed as incomprehensible or irrational, is particularly useful for thinking about affect. In a discussion of the enigmatic ‘<i>that feeling</i>, the <i>je ne sais quoi</i>’ of love, Berlant argues that ‘the agony of feeling upended by love is one of its pleasures, whether or not it feels so, because it is deemed an incontrovertible <i>sign</i>that one is in proximity to love.’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> The lover confronts those affects that are inchoate and contradictory with the intention of demanding meaning and figuring a structural explanation for them. The lover feels with a deep intensity, but they also inhabit a privileged space of self-conscious attention: whether fuelled by anxious doubt or ecstatic pleasure, they are compelled to be intimate with their loving affects, to linger and obsess over them. Given this, we should attend to what the lover says when they talk about love. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; With this in mind, I’ll turn now to Barthes’ <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i> in order to explore the various affects which it figures through describing the experience of love. An experience not only described but demonstrated: the text positions itself as a ‘simulation’ of the lover’s discourse, a ‘structural,’ as opposed to a psychological, ‘portrait’ manifested as an ‘utterance.’<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Reading this text, therefore, offers an opportunity to read a lover, to closely attend to his<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"></a></small> speech.<small>[25]</small> Ahmed briefly mentions Barthes’ text in <i>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</i>, citing it for the idea that the lover is in love with love itself.<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> This idea precedes Barthes, and, as Anne Boyer demonstrates, crops up in thinkers from Augustine to Dickinson to de Beauvoir.<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> That Ahmed turns to Barthes to find a textual manifestation of an age-old idea regarding love is indicative, I would argue, of the way that Barthes’ text serves as a compendium of the thoughts and feelings that emerge out of love, expressed directly and from the subject position of the lover. Barthes emphasises that the figures he presents are ‘the body’s gesture caught in action and not contemplated in repose’ (4), the text’s ‘active principle […] not what it says but what it articulates’ (6). The text claims to offer not a <i>theory o</i>f love but an <i>articulation</i> of love; rather than refer to his feelings, the lover of Barthes’ text demonstrates them. Despite this, such a precise and faithful articulation in fact becomes a uniquely pertinent and idiosyncratic form of theory: Lauren Berlant argues that ‘any social theory worthy of its ambition requires a space for enigmatic, chaotic, incoherent, and structurally contradictory attachments,’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> and <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>, with its 82 fragmentary sections organised in ‘an absolutely insignificant order’ (8), provides an appropriately ‘non-syntagmatic’ and ‘non-narrative’ theory of love to reflect the lover’s ‘horizontal discourse’ (7). &nbsp;‘I want to analyse, to know, to express in another language than mine,’ he tells us; ‘I want to represent my delirium to myself’ (60). Barthes’ lover both does and does not achieve this: he cannot escape the subject position of the lover, and cannot speak from outside the bounds of the lover’s discourse, yet the reader can read between the lines of the lover’s text, for its gaps and contradictions, and for the affective dynamism that motivates it. <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>, which Alain Robbe-Grillet refers to as Barthes’ ‘novel,’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> invites close reading: its theorisation of love happens not just in its propositions but the way it fuses an obliquely meandering texture, an anxiously exploratory rhythm, and a loose but wide-ranging citational method incorporating ‘books,’ ‘friends,’ and Barthes ‘own life’ (8).<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; What precisely are the affects that circulate in <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>, then, and where are they found? Firstly, joy emanates effortlessly and entirely from the beloved: ‘I rejoice,’ the lover tells us, at the arrival of one ‘whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions,’ one who is the ‘source of all good things.’ The metaphors Barthes’ lover uses here are telling: a ‘festivity is what is waited for,’ the satisfactions shall be ‘a banquet’ (119). Both terms evoke positive social abundance, images aligned with the way in which, for Berlant, attachment ‘describes the affective dimensions of […] relying on an object onto which fantasies of flourishing are projected, such as those of what a good life is.’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> Bearing in mind Ahmed’s argument regarding the way in which the loved object is entangled with social ideals in a way that reinforces normative hegemony, Barthes’ metaphoric movement, from the personal and particular affect of the lover seeing his beloved to the evocation of a festival of plenitude from which all good emerges, reflects the way in which love claims the apparent ability to elide the distance of the particular and the universal. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; In striking contrast to the positive affects which emerge from the beloved to ‘stream over’ the lover and ‘strike’ him ‘like a lightning bolt’ (54), the few vividly physical descriptions of bodily sensation all portray negative affects which come from within: anguish, despair, discomfort. An episode of ‘violent despair’ happens ‘after some incident,’ with such descriptive vagueness indicating the unimportance of its specificity to the affect that follows. The lover proceeds to ‘burst into sobs,’ to become ‘asphyxiated with pain’ as his ‘whole body stiffens and convulses’ (48). Other moments in which affect appears concretely in the text occur through frequent references to discomfort, in which the body becomes ‘a mass of irritable substance’ (95), most notably the longest direct quotation within <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>: Sappho’s fragment 20, in which ‘the tongue thickens’ as the skin breaks out in ‘subtle fire,’ and the eyes and ears are incapacitated as sweat streams down the shuddering body, which ‘in a moment more,’ feels as if it ‘shall die’ (155-6). <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Why is it that joy, when it does infrequently appear, is projected, whilst anguish, which appears so often, is described in a manner so intimate to the body of the lover? The lover offers three explanations. Firstly, he suggests that happiness does not necessarily produce speech: ‘Fulfilments […] are not spoken.’ In fulfilment, ‘language seems pusillanimous,’ for the lover is ‘transported, beyond language’; therefore, ‘the ego discourses only when it is hurt’ (55). Secondly, the lover links negative affect to concrete subjectivity. The lover tells us that he cries ‘in order to prove to myself that my grief is not an illusion,’ the tears functioning as palpable ‘signs, not expressions’ of the lover’s self-identity (182). The lover returns to this idea later, when he claims that ‘for us the “subject” (since Christianity) is <i>the one who suffers</i>’ (189). Finally, the lover argues that, in love, positive affects are inextricable from negative: to attempt to enjoy love’s pleasures without making the affective investments that cause future suffering ‘is a lunatic project,’ for the lover’s affective register ‘is <i>precisely</i> defined by its coalescence’ (51). In an essay considering love’s relation to politics Berlant admonishes Michael Hardt’s attempt to theorise a political project grounded in love, writing that ‘like so many social theorists of love, [Hardt] is faced with separating bad love (narcissism) from good love (openness to transformation).’<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small>&nbsp;In a similar spirit, Barthes’ lover tells us that he is unable ‘to confine myself to the lively pleasures the other affords me, without contaminating them, mortifying them by the anxiety which serves as their hinge’ (50). Anxiety is always a threatening presence in <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i>, even in moments of pleasure.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; The most significant anxieties Barthes’ lover expresses concern knowledge. Berlant argues that critical thought about desire ‘almost inevitably becomes theoretical thought about itself,’ for under scrutiny it ‘becomes unstable, mysterious, and recalcitrant,’ far less palpable that it seemed ‘when the thinker/lover first risked engagement.’<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small>&nbsp;Berlant’s idea of the lover’s epistemic frenzy manifests in Barthes’ lover as a desire to recognise the loved object as ‘atopos,’ or ‘unclassifiable, of a ceaselessly unforeseen originality’ (34). The lover draws out the paradoxical relation between recognition and the preservation of unrecognizability, calling to mind Berlant’s description of the ‘unintelligible’ as one of the ‘conventions of confusion that constitute evidence that we are in love’s domain,’<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> whilst Berlant’s point about the uneasy relationship between uniqueness and repetition is visible in the lover’s contradictions: the beloved ‘is, precisely, Unique […] yet I have loved or will love several times in my life’ (34). Here the lover articulates something other than what he says: in his constant reiteration of the beloved’s ‘brilliant originality,’ the lover claims that ‘one cannot speak <i>of</i> the other, <i>about</i> the other’ (134); the lover invests the beloved with a quality that demands to be classified, in speech, as unclassifiable and impossible to speak of. The lover’s discourse is populated with similar contradictions: the lover laments that he is ‘caught in this contradiction’ of believing he knows the beloved ‘better than anyone,’ yet he is ‘often struck by the obvious fact that the other is impenetrable, intractable, not to be found’ (134). Adam Phillips contends that although ‘lovers […] are notoriously frantic epistemologists,’ the lover is nonetheless alert to the idea that ‘knowing people […] can be counter-erotic.’<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> Barthes’ lover can help us understand the attraction of incomprehension; he writes that ‘to expend oneself, to bestir oneself for an impenetrable object is pure religion’ (135). Berlant writes that ‘pleasure is an experience of self-confirmation,’ and so it can be ‘a pleasure to feel unintelligible’;<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> a lack of sense can make sense, in the sense that love can make no sense and so no sense can mean love. The association of incomprehensibility with religion and eroticism drawn by Barthes’ lover is also an association with the affect Berlant references: the lover is ‘seized with that exaltation of loving <i>someone unknown</i>, someone who will remain &nbsp;so forever: a mystic impulse’ (135). Echoing the lover’s relation to his own joy, the lover elevates his beloved ‘beyond language, i.e. beyond the mediocre, beyond the general,’ and thus beyond comprehension (55). The lover’s epistemic anxiety, then, reflects the contradictory demands of the exaltation which constitutes the figure of the beloved.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; If the beloved is incomprehensible, the world around the lover is all too comprehensible. For the lover, ‘everything seems inert,’ and they can engage with the ‘disreality’ around them ‘only distractedly’ (87). As Becca Rothfeld argues, what Barthes presents here is analogous to depression: ‘love is a question of waiting’ in which ‘the lover waits, speaks, entreats, but the beloved is constitutionally silent’<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small>; &nbsp;in Barthes’s terms, ‘an always present <i>I</i> is constituted only by confrontation with an always absent <i>you</i>’ (13). For Rothfeld, ‘depression, too, is a form of waiting, for deliverance or vindication or a sudden onslaught of meaning that fails, devastatingly, to arrive.’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> Just as in <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i> the beloved ‘does not speak’ (3), so with depression the silent world appears to offer up no meaning. The lover insists that ‘love produces clear-sightedness’ through a kind of illuminated ‘reversal: what the world takes for “objective,” I regard as factitious; and what the world regards as madness, illusion, error, I take for truth’ (229-30). The world’s facticity is pessimistically experienced ‘as a generalized hysteria’ that the lover is ‘obliged to listen to (if not to take part in) […] absurdly,’ which ‘appals’ and ‘paralyzes’ him (88). What Barthes’ text makes clear for its reader is how the idealisation of the beloved is implicated in this diminution of all else, through the affect of shame. One of the distinctive ways in which shame manifests in the text is when the lover is ‘ashamed for the other’ (26). This shame, which we are told ‘kept the Greek lovers in the ways of the Good,’ occurs when the lover appears entangled with worldliness: the beloved ‘suddenly appears […] as <i>subjected</i> to an instance which is itself of a servile order’ (26). This is a shame of the minor, of the banal, the association of which with the image of the beloved is intolerable: ‘the bad image is not a wicked image; it is a <i>paltry</i>image: it shows me the other caught up in the platitude of the social world—commonplace’ (26).<br>
		<br>
		  &nbsp; &nbsp; Shame has a particular relevance to the queer sexuality of Barthes’ lover and, while Berlant discusses love itself as a ‘queer feeling’, it’s worth exploring the specific queerness of same-sex desire within Barthes’ text. As Ahmed argues, ‘we feel shame because we have failed to approximate “an ideal” that has been given to us,’ and therefore the feeling of shame consolidates and confirms an affective ‘commitment to such ideals in the first place.’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> This is ‘the role of shame in securing the (hetero)normative.’<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> Homosexuality in <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i> is elusive: both the lover and the beloved are identified as male by their pronouns, but queerness is never addressed directly. In ‘Intimacy: A Special Issue,’ Berlant explains that because in modern culture ‘only one plot counts as “life,”’ the love plot, ‘those who don’t or can’t find their way in that story—the queers, the single, the something else—can become so easily unimaginable, even often to themselves.’<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> On the same theme, Berlant confronts us with a set of pertinent questions in <i>Desire/Love</i>: <br></p>
		<br>
		<div class="quotation"><p>
		 What about the many times when love fails to sustain a concrete life context and the identities shaped within it? What about the times when the intimate other remains opaque to the desiring subject? Why are the transparency and simultaneity promised by love not automatically considered a mirage and a fraud, given the frequency with which this wish is disconfirmed by experience?</i><small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small></p></div>
		<br><p>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Resonating with Ahmed’s explication of the relationship between shamefully failing an ideal and affectively constituting that ideal, Berlant critiques the way in which ‘narratives of romantic failure are dedicated, frequently and paradoxically, to reanimating the belief in love’s promise.’<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> Of course, as I hope to have shown,&nbsp; <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i> is attuned to Berlant’s questions: it is about, among other things, the opacity of the beloved, the way in which love fails to sustain or support the lover’s life, and the disappointments and mirages and frauds of love; yet it refuses to recuperate these things into a defence or celebration of love. Barthes’ text can be read as resisting heteronormativity in its refusal to attach negative affects of love to what Barthes calls ‘the love story,’ which the ‘great narrative Other’ demands discursive fragments be ‘subjugated’ to in order ‘to be reconciled’ with the world (7). Jack Halberstam reminds us that ‘failing is something queers do and have always done exceptionally well,’ and that ‘under certain circumstances failing […] may in fact offer more creative, more cooperative, more surprising ways of being in the world.’<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> Halberstam usefully encourages us to ‘recognize failure as a way of refusing to acquiesce to dominant logics of power and discipline and as a form of critique.’<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> The lover forsakes capitalist ideals: opposed to the ‘bourgeois economy of repletion,’ he exuberantly propagates ‘a perverse economy of dispersion, of waste, of frenzy’ (85). Transcending the logic which dictates his failure, he ‘gladly’ exclaims that ‘the world subjects every enterprise to an alternative; that of success or failure, of victory or defeat. I protest by another logic: I am simultaneously and contradictorily happy and wretched […] I accept and I affirm, beyond truth and falsehood, beyond success and failure’ (22-3). For Berlant, ‘the notions of personal autonomy, consent, choice, and fulfilment so powerful in love discourse seem to be the same as those promised by national capitalism,’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> but Barthes’ lover rejects these notions of self-determination in his ‘structural,’ not ‘psychological portrait’ (3). In these ways, then, <i>A Lover’s Discourse</i> implicitly aligns itself with the emphasis in both Ahmed and Berlant on the political entanglements and political potentialities of affects. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude this essay, I’d like to reflect on the kind of writing love produces, and the kind of reading. The lover’s awareness of the difficulty of writing love hearkens back to Tomkins idea of the beloved’s ‘monopoly on many, if not all, good […] qualities’;<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> he perceives his beloved ‘as a Whole,’ as ‘<i>everything</i>,’ which he ‘cannot express’ for ‘the Whole cannot be inventoried without being diminished’ (19). Such a subject ‘can produce only an impropriety of language,’ but ‘this failure of language’ is itself felt as lack, an affective disappointment signifying and preserving the beloved’s transcendence (20). Love, therefore, can produce satisfyingly unsatisfying texts signifying through absence as much as presence; Barthes’ style is indefinite and slippery, obfuscating and wandering. Barthes’ friend Robbe-Grillet celebrates ‘the method he had been perfecting for many years,’ in which Barthes ‘withdraw[s] from what he [is] saying as he [says] it’;<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> ‘The Barthesian fragment is always slipping and its meaning lies […] in the very fact of slipping.’<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> This is the style of the lover, who tells us ‘I am trying to slip between the two members of the alternative: […] I stubbornly choose not to choose; I choose drifting’ (62). Barthes’ final lecture course, <i>The Preparation of the Novel</i>, posits ‘a discourse without arrogance,’ with Barthes delineating his ‘desire to arrive at a discursive practice that puts no pressure on anyone else.’<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> In a tribute to Barthes, Brian Dillon describes how as a teenager ‘it was not so much the thought that seduced me […] as Barthes’ style,’ such as ‘the hedging of parentheses, the sidelong views calmly opened and closed by em-dashes, the colons like stiles that invite one to clamber on over the thought.’<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> Reading, too, is a kind of loving: Dillon writes, joyfully, ‘I had found (as Barthes liked to put it) my critic, my thinker, my writer.’<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> In Barthes’ terms, reading here gives ‘the delight of understanding’ which is a delight ‘of being understood’ (9). ‘Ideally,’ Barthes writes, <i>A Lover’s Discourse </i>‘would be a co-operative: “To the United Readers and Lovers”’(5). Barthes claims that ‘from meeting and falling in love with a handful of texts the <i>Hope to write</i> is born’: this is because ‘every beautiful work […] functions as a desired work, […] incomplete and as it were lost <i>because I didn’t write it myself</i>; […] I want to <i>actively</i> add myself to something that’s beautiful but that I lack, that I <i>require</i>.’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> To love a text is to commit to brazenly subjective reading, what Barthes calls ‘particular, local readings’;<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> it is to involve yourself in it and surround yourself with it, not only to luxuriate within its passages but to attain a level of intimacy where the boundary between your thought and the text begins to blur. This is the kind of reading as loving, which is also a kind of reading as writing, that Barthes describes in <i>The Rustle of Language</i>, a reading ‘insolent’ and ‘smitten’: ‘Has it never happened, as you were reading a book, that you kept stopping as you read, not because you weren’t interested, but because you were: because of a flow of ideas, stimuli, associations? In a word, haven’t you ever happened <i>to read while looking up from your book</i>?’<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> Barthes shows us how loving Barthes, as with any beloved text, is to love in Barthes, to love during Barthes and beside Barthes, away from and towards but most importantly for <i>your</i> Barthes. Berlant, Ahmed and Barthes may complicate love, may show the way love is often the product and the cause of affects and attachments that don’t seem anything like what we look for when we look for love. Nevertheless, in reading and writing Barthes that surely is there, too.<div style="text-align: center"><br>
