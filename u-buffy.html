		  <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> as Disturbing Second Childhood
		</h3>
		<br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;When the recently re-souled Angel tells Spike and Drucilla that Buffy ‘made me feel like a human being. That’s not the kind of thing you just forgive’ (<i>Buffy</i> 2.14), we understand it both as a witty one-liner and something more serious. For one of the most startling things about <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, a show that veers semi-schizophrenically from the enjoyable melodrama of teen life to the genuinely painful real drama of teen life, is the range and depth of what it makes us feel. And is this the kind of thing we can just forgive? In this paper I’m going to try to come to terms with how exactly <i>Buffy</i> produces its range of emotions, focusing particularly on moments where the show appears to place its viewer vicariously in situations that would seemingly be far from enjoyable to live through. I’ll then try and take apart the assumptions of this claim: whether these unhappy moments are truly unhappy; whether the kind of relationship with the viewer the show does engender is a simply sympathetic one. The answer to these questions lies in an examination of the self-aware comedy of the third season episode ‘Band Candy’: a not-so-serious reflexivity that, like almost everything in <i>Buffy</i>, simultaneously contains a depth much more serious than it appears. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting aside (for now) Buffy’s eternal fight with the undead, the early seasons of <i>Buffy</i>’s most forceful plot line is her relationship with Angel, containing the highs and the lows of <i>Buffy</i>’s emotional palette. The show handles all of its emotions vividly, and shifts tonal register deftly: in episode seven of season one, ‘Angel,’ a straight up fight scene follows the title sequence, which segues into a chase scene (complete with tense music and fast cuts). After leading Angel to her house and slamming the door, Buffy looks out of the windows at the darkened faces of growling vampires prowling the front porch in shots evoking horror iconography (zombie movies and <i>The Evil Dead</i>). As the vampires recede into darkness and Angel explains they can’t enter the house, the tone shifts: the low-key lighting of the dark living room replaced by the (comparably) brighter kitchen (illustrating the move from supernatural to personal issues). A different tension replaces danger when Buffy watches Angel take his shirt off, exacerbated by the low-level camera close-up shots of Buffy’s face (7:27) looking up at Angel (who frames the right side of the shot cropped by the lens so as to be only jawline and pectoral muscle). Buffy’s bandages Angel (the superficial reason they are standing millimeters away from each other) out of frame, with the camera instead focusing on their eye contact and angled to position them even closer in the frame. The non-diegetic music of earlier is gone, replaced by close microphones picking up sounds as subtle as rustling bandage and slight variations in voice. Essentially the scene is intensely intimate, designed to draw the viewer astonishingly close to the feelings of the characters.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;But this intense emotion swings the other way too: Buffy’s first meeting with Angel after he loses his soul exchanges the excitement and bashfulness of the earlier scene with a humiliation and confusion just as heightened. Accompanied by melancholy piano, Buffy enters Angel’s apartment (<i>Buffy</i> 2.14, 14:10), an austere and dramatic environment almost entirely grey (matching Buffy’s black and white outfit) except for the red bed, wholly red from the pillows to the wood frame to the lampshade beside it, evoking either love or danger or both. Angel enters the room to an ominous non-diegetic sound, not looking at her. His shirt off evokes the scene from above, but this time it’s a statement of power and disinterest. Buffy’s crying emphasized her vulnerability, and by the close-up shot utilized previously again emphasizing the way Angel exceeds the frame and towers over her. The scene moves to actively painful when Angel interjects with ‘what, I took off,’ and walks off camera leaving Buffy alone in the frame. She turns, her face still wet, and the tone of her voice changed, and follows Angel across the room where the shot will be framed by his back and arm. The camera keeps returning to Buffy’s confused face staying centered on her even as Angel moves freely around the frame laughing confidently, and her question ‘was it not good?’ again underscores her total vulnerability. The scene becomes emotionally torturous as Angel makes jokes at her expense, then tries to touch her face before she jumps back, and ends with a crying Buffy alone in the room after Angel mockingly says ‘I’ll call you’ without looking back at her. I haven't been able to capture the intensity of this scene, but that's kind of the point: the scene hurts, and its formal qualities bring the tremendous depth of Buffy’s sadness unusually close. What did we do to deserve this level of emotion? <i>Buffy</i> brings us so close to these painful emotions to offer us a kind of vicariousness, an opportunity to re-experience the seismic intensity of feeling that being a teenager engenders. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;And, moreover, the show is keenly self-aware about its ability to place us, in the act of watching, even briefly, as ourselves teenage. The episode ‘Band Candy’ stages the quite literal transformation of Sunnydale’s adults into ‘teenagers: it’s a sobering mirror to look into, huh?’ (Oz in <i>Buffy </i>3.6, 22:10). But while Oz may be sobered by watching the town’s adults drunkenly sing Louie Louie on stage, how are actual adults meant to react to this scene? The scenes are played comically: watching Mrs. Barton and Principal Snyder break character from their stuffy everyday personas and act outrageously is a lot of fun. The teenage personas the adults adopt encompass two main traits: the abandoning of responsibility to do ‘what I want to do, so get off my back!’ (Joyce in <i>Buffy </i>3.6, 28:45), and an intensity of feeling seen when Giles (or, rather, Ripper) literally shakes with satisfaction as he listens to Cream and exclaims ‘wait a minute, listen to this bit. It… rocks!’ (<i>Buffy </i>3.6, 18:25). The show reveals its reflexivity by both of these postures being essentially descriptive of the <i>Buffy </i>viewer. Watching television is intrinsically linked to escapism, it ‘often serves as a substitute for lived experience’ (McLean 5); as I’ve demonstrated in the first section of this paper, one of <i>Buffy</i>’s defining features is a constant striving to bring its audience incredibly close to its characters’ intense emotions (and, by extension, produce these emotions in the viewer themselves). Unlike the coolness of a show like <i>The X-Files</i>, which McLean reads as expression that ‘we all want <i>not</i> to be excited, agitated, or aroused by everything we see and experience’ (McLean 9), <i>Buffy</i> consistently strives to express and impose an excitement and agitation of a kind uncommon to adult life. While Ripper may be moody, and Snyder may be outraged when his chocolate bar is stolen, the through-line of the entire episode is fun: both the adults and the viewer enjoying life as a whirlwind of teenage hormones. This is why the feelings the show engenders in us at scenes such as Buffy and Angel’s humiliating conversation in ‘Innocence,’ or Angel’s death in ‘Becoming Part 2,’ are more complex than merely empathy. When I watched them I, obviously, cried with the characters, but I also couldn’t stop thinking this was some of the best television I had ever watched. So what does that mean?<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In ‘Band Candy,’ teen Joyce tells Ripper that she feels ‘special’ (<i>Buffy </i>3.6, 24:20), but more importantly that ‘getting married and having a kid and everything was just a dream and now things are back like they’re supposed to be.’ There’s an undercurrent here, an undercurrent that matches what can be considered the central theme of the show: the loss of youth. As part of his delineation of <i>Buffy</i> as ‘mourning play without mourning’ (Adler 9), by which he means a show about mourning where the characters are unable to mourn, Adler refers to Buffy’s mission as ‘not sacred, not revolutionary, but only counter-demonic and, moreover, thoroughly reactionary in its impulse’ (Adler 18). Buffy does not create, she maintains the status quo by holding back (again, and again) the forces of evil. But while Buffy cannot mourn her innumerable losses (Angel, the plethora of deaths around her, her childhood and innocence and feelings), the show places the viewer in a position of mourning. Adler takes his conception of mourning from Benjamin, who defined it as ‘the state of mind in which feeling revives the empty world in the form of a mask, and derives an enigmatic satisfaction in contemplating it’ (Benjamin 139). Those conflicted feelings that <i>Buffy</i> engenders in its saddest scenes are ones of enigmatic satisfaction, and this can function, for the viewer, as a form of contemplating their own lost past. The terms with which Adler describes Buffy, counter-demonic and reactionary, I would instead apply to the audience: <i>Buffy</i>’s focus on the intensity of teenage life angles the viewer to look not forwards but backwards, into a mode that in other situations would be self-conscious but is here mesmerized. Mourning can become ‘so intense that a turning away from reality takes place and a clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis’ (Freud 244). If the viewer is to be seen as potential mourner for their own teenage passion then ‘Band Candy,’ especially in the context of Joyce’s affirmation that ‘things are back like they’re supposed to be,’ can be read as a hallucinatory wishful manifestation of the Sunnydale adults’ desire to be teenagers again, a desire the show acknowledges and encourages in its viewers through presenting the most vivid emotions possible.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of putting a hallucinatory wishful psychosis is fantasy, which of course is one way of defining <i>Buffy</i>’s genre. I’ve avoided speaking about the supernatural elements of the show until now, but vampires are essentially a metaphor for the irrefutable claims the dead hold over the living, that the past holds over the present: my argument is simply that in staging this relationship between past and present internally, that the show also creates an external relationship to mirror it. Abraham and Torok’s writing seems particularly apt to <i>Buffy</i>, evoking the lost object as ‘the ghost of the crypt,’ placed there deep inside of ourselves in a refusal to mourn, but which ‘in the dead of the night […] comes back to haunt the cemetery guard’ (Abraham and Torok, 130). Although <i>Buffy</i> is fantasy, which usually has ‘a preventive and conservative function [that] tends to transform the world rather than inflict injury on the subject’ (Abraham and Torok, 125) (and this conservative function is what manifests internally on the show counter-demonically), this fantasy is instead the ghosts, or rather demons and vampires, of our crypts. The show haunts by confronting us with a fantasy of teen life, and encouraging us to voyeuristically return to the impassioned emotions and vitality that teen years engender. However, in providing this fantasy within a fantastical world of vampires and adults able to become teenagers, <i>Buffy</i> simultaneously argues that teen life and impassioned emotions are fantasies exactly because they are dead, irretrievably lost, and therefore something to mourn.<br>
