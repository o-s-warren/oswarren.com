				Particularly resonant right now, of course, but essential viewing besides that. Again, the pacing is inherently productive when tied to films that are so formally precise, and sitting with the ambiguities of Akerman's filmic reality is a real
				privilege.

				Some of the concerns of the astonishing first third that felt most important came out of the juxtaposition of a silent character and a first-person past tense voiceover - raising all kinds of questions about identity and self-fashioning, the
				function of internal monologue and self-description when you're alone with yourself, and Akerman really exploits the particular techniques of film to convey the peculiarities of self-understanding. It's about isolation, at least at first, but
				coming to us through the medium of film it can't help but be about the ways in which we relate, how we read and interpret gesture and presence - and the ways in which these questions remain crucial to our sense of self and reality, even when
				we're supposedly alone, in a way that feels so pressing especially now.

				In Michael Baxandall's <i>Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy</i>, Baxandall details some of the standard viewing experiences of Pre-Renaissance religious art (bear with me). The saints were recognised by their clothing,
				accessories and gestures - and the reason likeness was unimportant (along with expression, often a kind of serene plainness), was because each viewer (many of whom were illiterate) would have their own visual conception of each saint or holy
				figure. These would be built up through years of listening to sermons and pondering, and churchgoers were often explicitly encourage to imagine these characters with the faces of their own loved ones. In order for religious paintings to make
				sense as aids to piety, it was important that the figures could be projected onto - the work of the viewer in recognising the agreed-upon codes of gesture and garment was essential in their engagement (and that they were themselves engaging so
				much as to be providing much of the content themselves was crucial to the experience's religiosity). Akerman's Julie (or, 'Je') too maintains a kind of blankness throughout the film, besides her beatific smile, and there are many parallels to
				early modern conceptions of religious understanding (from the cloistered lifestyle to the rejection of belongings). What is conveyed in this film is concrete action and gesture, including in the matter-of-fact voice over, and Akerman brings the
				experience of early modern visual art, with its insistence on viewerly engagement to produce meaning, to contemporary self-consciousness - in all its ambiguity and resonance. Just as the painting would allow its viewers to practice the
				experience of understanding perception in the early modern period (through the time's religious framework), so Akerman's films allow one to probe perception through experiencing the concrete meaning-producing ambiguity of the other’s
				materiality in today's world (and this is all before even dealing with the role of gender in the film, and the final scene's literalisation of the complicated potentialities and difficulties of self and other in contact). God I'm looking
				forward to going outside, eventually.</p>
