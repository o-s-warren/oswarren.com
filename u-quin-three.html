		<h3>
		<br>A Metaphor for Her Condition Without Defining It: Ann Quin and Gender</h3><br>
		
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In a 1964 letter to Father Brocard Sewell, Quin talks about the difficulty of her lifestyle as a writer:<br><p>
		  <br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>[O]n such occasions I say: oh I’m deluding myself with this writing lark, why don’t I get down to having a normal life, be a woman, get settled, have children, and lead a quite ordinary time. Of course, fortunately (but for who—only myself I suppose?!) these moments don’t last all that long.<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Here Quin suggests that ‘to be a woman’ is contingent on ‘a normal life,’ ‘settled’ with ‘children,’ and incompatible with writing. Many years earlier, Quin complains of the ‘sad day when the seed entered the wrong ovum and I was conceived a girl, […] I would have made a wonderful man besides people take more notice of a male writer,’<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> and in an interview after the release of her final novel, states that ‘I think everyone is bisexual, and people ought to explore the fact a bit more.’<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> These three comments, about the definition of woman in relation to a family unit, cultural resistance or ignorance towards women’s writing, and fluid sexuality, point to the way Quin engages with gender, despite the neglect of Quin’s work by generations of feminist literary criticism.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> Mitchell notes that Quin’s oeuvre is difficult ‘to pin down in terms of its gender politics, suffused as it is with intimations of sexual violence, feminine masochism and bodily disgust,’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> but more general arguments about the reception of women’s experimental writing can be applied here too. Marianne Dekoven describes an ‘Anglo-American literary feminist hostility or indifference to […] the (putative) cultural marginality of the avant-garde,’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> whilst Brooke-Rose points out that the feminism of Quin’s context had ‘no time to notice or to make an effort to understand, let alone to back’ the work of ‘innovative women’ who didn’t easily fall into the category of ‘woman writer.’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> In combination with the male literary avant-garde’s well-documented sexism, however, refusing such a category causes experimental women writers ‘to belong nowhere,’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> arguably Quin’s situation both in her lifetime and after her death. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years the only scholarship on Quin was Stevick’s ‘Voices in the Head,’ published in Friedman and Fuch’s influential <i>Breaking the Sequence</i> alongside the Dekoven and Brooke-Rose essays mentioned above. In their introduction, the editors argue that ‘radical forms—nonlinear, non-hierarchical, and decentering—are, in themselves, a way of writing the feminine.’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> This theoretical framework fails to register the particularities of Quin’s engagement with gender. A key source for Friedman and Fuchs is the writing of the <i>Mouvement de Liberation des Femmes (MLF)</i>, and the term <i>écriture féminine</i>originally coined by Helene Cixous, which, in their words, imitates ‘the rhythms and sexuality of women,’ ‘disrupting conventional narrative’ as ‘nonlinear, polyphonic, open-ended.’<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> Julia Kristeva’s descriptions of <i>écriture féminine</i> accords with Quin’s work, particularly the fragmentary <i>Passages</i>: the ‘specificity of female psychology’ is expressed for Kristeva as ‘an irreducible identity, without equal in the opposite sex and, as such, exploded, plural, fluid, in a certain way nonidentical.’<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> It is unclear, however, that this is a “feminine” specificity, or that Quin’s own terms would posit her work in this way: Quin’s belief that ‘everyone is bisexual,’<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> alongside her writing moving between male and female perspectives, instead recalls Brooke-Rose’s conclusion in ‘Illiterations,’ notably against the grain of the collection in which it features. Brooke-Rose denies the existence of gendered writing as she calls for a ‘bisexual effort,’ in which ‘both should read as both, just as both write as both,’ identifying the distinction between masculine and feminine as occurring not in writing but in reading, a problem to be solved by a ‘delightful bisexualism.’<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> Kristeva asks us to ‘call the moment of rupture and negativity which conditions and underlies the novelty of any praxis “feminine,”’<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> reminding us that, ‘for at least a century, the literary avant-garde (from Mallarmé and Lautréamont to Joyce and Artaud) has been introducing ruptures, blank spaces, and holes into language.’<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small>&nbsp;Such features can be found in women writers including Quin, but as Dekoven points out, for Kristeva, ‘<i>écriture féminine</i> is the male avant-garde.’<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Brooke-Rose sees too that the techniques of ‘feminine specificity […] consist of circular structures, open endings, non-linearity and, for some, disruption of structures,’ and that ‘these have all been used by men.’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> Her conclusion is that ‘the feminist thesis of specificity’ should be abandoned by those engaging with <i>écriture féminine</i>, for ‘what matters is the way they [these features] are used.’<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> Following Brooke-Rose’s injunction, the remainder of this chapter will draw conclusions from chapter two’s close readings, finding a feminist praxis not in Quin’s illegibility but in a legible attitude to gender and identity.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than the <i>écriture féminine </i>of Kristeva and Cixous, I would contend that Quin’s texts are more productively placed in conversation with the work of another figure associated with the <i>MLF</i>, Monique Wittig. Wittig contends ‘that a new personal and subjective definition for all humankind can only be found beyond the categories of sex (woman and man).’<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> A key feature of Quin’s texts is her experiments with pronouns; Wittig writes that, although ‘they pass unnoticed, pronouns ‘are instrumental in activating the notion of gender.’<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> Quin’s pronouns function in obtuse ways, making manifest their usually subtle machinations as they work against a smooth reading experience. Wittig maintains that pronouns are ‘abstract philosophical categories’ that demonstrate how ‘language casts sheaves of reality upon the social body, stamping it and violently shaping it,’<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> an idea borne out across Quin’s work. The authority of <i>Berg</i>’s third-person perspective is undermined by consistent slippage into first- and second-person; Wittig writes that ‘each time I say <i>I</i>, I reorganize the world from my point of view,’ and yet the deranged Berg’s compromised perspective, badly disguising itself in the cloak of an objective narrative style, enacts a failed ‘claim to universality’ each time an I emerges.<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> S’s tapes in <i>Three</i> are notable in erasing the first-person pronoun, occurring only in the overheard speech of others: for Wittig, the first-person pronoun ‘implies the locutor be an absolute subject,’ since ‘a relative subject could not speak at all.’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> The fragmented record of S, only experienced directly in her transcribed tapes, serves not as speech but the trace of speech annulled; S’s role in the story is as a violently erased presence around which the complicit characters attempt to live. For Wittig, the gendered third-person pronoun is key to the functioning of heterosexist patriarchy: it ‘corresponds to a constant attempt to strip [women] of […] subjectivity.’<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> In the first and third sections of <i>Passages</i>, the female narrator’s subjectivity is consistently destabilised. Not only does her pronoun constantly shift between ‘I’ and ‘her,’ but the other women who feature in the story are, like her, faceless and anonymous, leading to porous boundaries between the narrator and the objectified subjectivities of the other female characters: </p><br>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>Scattered light played with fingers, parts of the body. Bodies. […] She danced round […] He hung from the bed. Onto her, from her. Movement above, I moved with, into. […] the pattern formed, collected in parts.<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		<p>Significantly, ‘parts of the body. Bodies’ endure in the women’s annulled subjectivity. Wittig insists we ‘must understand that men are not born with a faculty for the universal and that women are not reduced at birth to the particular,’ but rather ‘the universal has been, and is continually, […] appropriated by men.’<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> The marginality of women in a hegemonic patriarchal discourse, as demonstrated in <i>Passages</i>, involves not just denying them a universal subject-perspective but in treating them as partial, as parts.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering Quin’s challenging texts as <i>écriture féminine</i> does her work’s gender politics a disservice, for Quin resists the logic of feminine specificity. Wittig critiques the view, later emphasized by trans-exclusionary radical feminists,<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small> ‘that the basis of women’s oppression <i>is biological as well as historical,</i>’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> by pointing out that such a view is symmetrical with the essentialism propagated by patriarchy, complicit with it in supposing ‘a “natural” division between women and men’ and thus ‘making change impossible.’<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> As Brooke-Rose demonstrates, despite occurring in writing by men and women, ‘fragmentation and disruption is often claimed [...] as specifically feminine,’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> whilst Wittig’s work warns us against adopting ‘the myth of woman which was created by men especially for us.’<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a> In a similar spirit Brooke-Rose asks us: ‘are flux and chaos in fact what feminists should defend?’<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> Dekoven critiques <i>écriture féminine </i>for claiming ‘for women or the feminine a privileged, transgressive marginality in relation to hegemonic culture,’ which ends up reifying the gendered othering of women: ‘women must <i>be</i> difference.’<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Whilst Brooke-Rose tempered her experimentalism with formal restraints, Quin’s apparently chaotic blurring of boundaries also avoids fetishizing flux and chaos as the product of a gendered essence: <i>Berg</i>’s chaotic style mirrors Berg’s chaotic perspective; Quin’s most fragmentary text, <i>Tripticks</i>, is written from a male character’s perspective; the man’s sections of <i>Passages</i> embrace a standpoint ‘without name, without identity.’<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small><b> </b>Quin demonstrates an understanding of the social contingency of gendered categories when she contemplates giving up writing to ‘be a woman,’<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> resonating with Wittig’s conception of women as a class. For Wittig, the category of woman<i> </i>is defined through a heterosexist relation to men; such relations are represented in S’s ‘inability to fit into a heteronormative world,’ epitomised by Leonard and Ruth’s ‘mundane and yet traumatic’ marriage, an inability presented not through S’s interior meditations but through her interactions with others.<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;For Wittig, the category of ‘woman’ is a ‘political and ideological formation,’ whereas ‘women’ in the plural refers to a class, a ‘product of a relation of exploitation.’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> This formulation, dissociating the essentialist ‘myth’ of ‘woman’ from the ‘class within which we fight,’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> allows for solidarity against patriarchal subjugation without conceding ‘so-called natural differences’ which in fact ‘always belong to an economic, political, ideological order.’<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> Wittig’s work can be of use to contemporary feminisms, which Lucy Freedman has recently argued face ‘a false dichotomy: should we, those whose bodies are read and enforced as female, identify with or reject the gender imposed upon us?’<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> Quin’s work too, emerging at a pivotal time for second-wave feminism, is useful for thinking through questions of category and class in relation to women and women’s writing, identification and solidarity, including as part of a contemporary scholarly effort to return to the ‘multivocal and multivalent complexities’ often elided by a ‘collective memory’ of ‘1970s feminism’ as reducible to ‘white feminism’ or ‘trans-exclusionary feminism.’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> The conflicted legacy of second-wave feminism most potently revolves around questions of identification, specifically of exclusion and gatekeeping within the feminist movement. Yet Freedman contends that ‘identification is only a tiny part of what gender is’ because ‘to <i>be gendered</i> is a process which occurs externally,’<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> with identity being ‘often something etched onto us, rather than something we ourselves have the agency to adopt, mould or reject.’<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> As Denise Riley puts it, querying sexual categorisation is not enough ‘to vault over the harshness of lived gender,’<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> for even if feminist theoretical work demonstrates ‘that “women” don’t exist […] the world behaves as if they unambiguously did.’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> Quin demonstrates an awareness of violent categorisation: engaged with heterosexist sexual dynamics, her texts explore these relations whilst rejecting stable definitions and embracing porous outlines over concrete essences in the same way that <i>Passages’ </i>female protagonist ‘finds a metaphor for her condition without defining it.’<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> Across her career, Quin reiterates the stifling repressions and dead ends of bourgeois heteronormativity, represented as a kind of horror, from the protagonists of ‘A Double Room’ and <i>Three</i> through to <i>Tripticks</i>, in which we are given what Quins calls a ‘mood-portrait of modern woman: boredom at the level of panic, a yawn that comes out a scream.’<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> The phrase is appropriated from a 1971 review of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, elsewhere in which the anonymous critic praises Hedda ‘not only as modern woman but as modern human being,’<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> and is a portrait not of essence but of situation, a portrait of woman as ‘product of a relation of exploitation’ that pushes the boundaries of definition:<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> here a yawn is a scream, the contrary affects of boredom and panic intermingled.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedman calls for forging ‘a collective subject-position not directly through <i>identification</i>, but rather <i>solidarity,</i>’ in recognition ‘that “woman” as a political identity is a temporary and fluid one, but that the experience of being gendered is not elective.’<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> Although Quin’s characters may seem to forsake their outlines and identities, their situations are consistently of pervasive male domination, often manifested explicitly as past or present violence. These characters are unable to escape their world’s patriarchal structuring despite, like Quin, rejecting its bourgeois terms of heterosexual monogamy. What is concrete in the elusive character of S, whose forcefully unpredictable nature still reverberates through Ruth and Leonard’s marriage long after her death, is the trauma emerging from the abuse she has suffered before arriving to live with the couple; likewise, the female protagonist of <i>Passages</i> endures sexual and psychological violence from both the male protagonist and a range of other anonymous male characters in her expansive travels in search of her lost brother. Quin manages to explore heteropatriarchal categories as socially constructed whilst still weighing down on subjects in concrete ways; in <i>Tripticks</i>intersubjectivity is ‘a fluid dance’ in which ‘fantasy has the weight of fact […] and fact has the metaphoric potential of fantasy.’<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> In her amorphous presentation of sexual relations, Quin anticipates some of the preoccupations of queer theory, which Cathy J. Cohen defines as standing ‘in direct contrast to the normalizing tendencies of hegemonic sexuality rooted in ideas of static, stable sexual identities and behaviours.’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> Almost all of Quin’s writing features fluid sexuality, and yet there is no extended thematization or theorisation of sexual identities, and no identity categories are referenced or evoked. Loraine Morley calls Quin’s writing ‘promiscuous […] in the sense that it no more concerns itself with consistency either of textual or sexual identity than with supporting a socio-cultural tradition of monogamy.’<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> It’s worth noting here that no previous scholarship, or any published material surrounding the recent reissuing of her work, has situated Quin, whose personal life and published work are both demonstrably and openly bisexual, as a queer writer. Yet the politics of sexuality this chapter has established to be present in Quin’s work certainly follow the spirit of queer studies as theorised many years after her death: queer not as ‘an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trangendered,’ but ‘first and foremost’ a politics which ‘recognizes and encourages the fluidity and movement of people’s sexual lives,’ in which ‘sexual expression is something that always entails the possibility of change, movement, redefinition, and subversive performance.’<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Quin’s personal life was one of endless movement away from the structure and stillness of bourgeois and patriarchal social relations which she depicted both formally and thematically across her oeuvre, and towards an experimentally unknown outcome, refusing to invest in received and socially constructed categories while keenly aware of the serious reality of their violent and denaturing material effects, the costs that accompany transgression. The recent revival of interest in Quin’s work in particular helps us to understand the preoccupations and investments of our own time<b>. </b>Quin was an experimental, working-class and, as I’ve argued above, queer woman writer, the kind of voice that was not privileged in her own context but is increasingly and necessarily centred in ours.<small><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small> This dissertation has aimed to demonstrate how Quin’s writing uniquely expands the investment in experimentalism present among her peers to create challenging and difficult work: work that anticipate the feminist and queer scholarship produced in the generations after her early death whilst asking readers to inhabit a textual world that does away with the harmful reassurances of received forms and categories. <i>Passages,</i> Quin’s favourite of her own works,<small><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small> ends with a request:</p><br>
		<br>
		  <div class="quotation"><p>So let us begin another journey. Change the setting. Everything is changing, the country, the climate. There is no compromise now. No country we can return to. She still has her obsession to follow through and her fantasies to live out. For myself there is less of an argument. I am for the moment committed to this moment. This train. The distance behind and ahead. And the sea that soon perhaps we will cross[.]<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small></p></div>
		<br>
		This final contradictory passage urges us to commit ourselves to this porous moment which is also a distance behind and ahead, and ends with an image of where such a journey could take us, a sentence unfinished and open that resonates across Quin’s life, work, and death, bearing the promise of possibility and the cost of casting out from static ways of being as we accompany Quin into the expansive boundary of a sea that soon, perhaps, we will cross.<br>
