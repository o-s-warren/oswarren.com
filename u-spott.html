		    <div class="spott"><i>“I just feel like we’re at a university, and we should be able to debate controversial views without people becoming all sensitive.” It was half past three in the morning, and only around half of the people left at the party
		        were students. The trans woman who had been politely justifying her own existence for the last couple of hours, for example, was not a student. The cis woman who had been asking the questions, and was now carelessly instrumentalising some
		        vague notion of free speech or intellectual integrity, was a PhD student in the humanities. The fact I don’t know whether such information is relevant is depressing. The fact I didn’t catch the moment an opportunity to tell one’s own story
		        became a debate is revealing. Jacqueline Rose tells us that trans people are brilliant at telling their stories,</i><small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" class="spott"><i>[3]</i></a></small><i> and across that night the cis woman was
		        provided with a range of them: stories about childhood, stories about lipstick, stories about statistics. With each answer received, the questioner would ask a new question, demand a new and different narrative. What is a trans* narrative?
		        When are they invoked, and by whom, and to what end? Who tells them, and what is to be gained and lost in their telling?</i><br></div>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <br><div class="para"><p>
		    &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s unclear what Verity Spott’s <i>Trans* Manifestos</i> are, even though the poet tells us. ‘This is a collection of attempted essays and manifestos whose composition began in 2011,’<small><a href="#_ftn4"
		        name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> Spott writes, that correct but still unnerving genitive pronoun gesturing towards a kind of slippery liveliness. The line between essay and manifesto isn’t drawn, whether the terms are used distinctly or as
		    hendiadys, and regardless the collection contains texts that seem to fit neither description, such as the interrupted conversational prologue on page three and the fragmented poetic passages throughout. Spott tells us that ‘every word contains at
		    least five’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> and although the collection is a short one, written and mostly published on Spott’s blog between 2011 and 2016,<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> it gestures
		    or makes references towards a wide variety of political and theoretical questions about gender, identity, and visibility. Manifestos such as Sandy Stone’s ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ have been foundational to what, in homage to Hélène Cixous,
		    Juliet Jacques terms <i>écriture trans</i>,<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> although Spott evokes the interventionist form in an idiosyncratic way. Figuring a manifesto as an endeavour not only to document and perpetuate a
		    position but to maintain and make manifest an intention and ability, Spott writes that the <i>Manifestos</i> ‘are described as such because […] they felt like attempts at preservation; of life and the capacity to struggle against life.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small> Both the terms ‘struggle’ and ‘preservation’ bring to mind a defensive posture not usually associated with the proclamatory manifesto form, in line with the author’s attempt ‘to explain and
		    discredit what a trans* manifesto can actually do.’<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> The manifesto’s formal qualities are skewed, too. The first section which announces itself (in brackets) to be a manifesto begins with the
		    statement that ‘the “trans community” is as confused as its components.’<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> Direct, declarative, provocative, it bears all the stylistic traits a manifesto could want. Yet the sense it makes
		    is hard to feel confident in, for to settle on referents for both the ‘trans community’ (especially in its scare quotes) and ‘its components’ leads to a variety of reductive or nonsensical arguments. If we take components, a bizarrely mechanical
		    term, as members, and trans community at face value, then the text states a community is as confused as its members: a point that seems obvious. Noting the lack of asterisk,<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> if we treat
		    ‘trans community’ as an overheard phrase then arguing it is as linguistically confused as its two parts (trans and community) seems again tautological. The use of ‘components’ seems to foreground an explicit relation between the parts and the
		    whole: if a thing’s components have a quality, it surely follows that the thing has this quality. Or, perhaps, it doesn’t. Because otherwise why say it? For this kind of logic, of identity and qualities and likenesses and components, is what
		    the<i> Manifestos</i> seems to explicitly reject. Telling the reader that ‘the narratives imposed upon the “trans* community” are as damaging as abject (trans*) phobia because that is exactly what they are,’<small><a href="#_ftn12"
		        name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Spott self-consciously reveals the insidiously dangerous dynamics at work in trans* narratives, in any justification and explanation of the trans* subject.<br>
		    <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;There are two targets in talk of trans* narratives. The first is the ‘media organs […] obsessed with our bodies,’ with their ‘gross and mawkish preoccupation with gender essentialism.’<small><a href="#_ftn13"
		        name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> As Julia Serano demonstrates in <i>Whipping Girl</i>, recent representations of trans* people in the media often explicitly reinforce gender essentialism: ‘because we are a threat to the categories that
		    enable traditional and oppositional sexism, the images and experiences of trans people are presented in the media in a way that reaffirms, rather than challenges, gender stereotypes.’<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small>
		    Spott makes a vital point in accusing the media not just of blithely reifying gender essentialism, which they of course do, but of returning obsessively to the question of essentialism whenever transness is concerned, repeatedly rehearsing a
		    ‘gross and mawkish’ veneer of sickly faux-sentimentalism, false intentions and bad-faith naivety masking a prurient preoccupation with bodies and artifice. As Serano has shown, the media has a track record of manipulating trans women (whose media
		    coverage vastly outweighs that of trans men) into presenting themselves in ways that depict a supposedly artificial femininity through repetitive shots of putting on make-up,<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> or the
		    fervent exhibiting of before and after photos;<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> such examples complicate the distinction between media depiction and self-representation and demonstrate the way in which both can be ‘imposed.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> The second, major target of Spott’s critique throughout the collection is the ‘narratives at play within the “T,”’ the narratives both internal to and emanating from the ‘“trans community,”’
		    and the way they are spoken in dialogue with medical institutions. Addressing the most well-known of the justifications for transition, Spott writes that ‘<i>I was born in the wrong body</i> is […] only a part way saver,’ a short-term strategy
		    that ‘will hurt a hell of a lot.’<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small><br>
		    <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp; As Jacqueline Rose writes in her wide-ranging study of trans* writing, wrong-body accounts ‘seem to be the ones that most easily make it into the public eye, as if a shocked world can heave something like a collective sigh of
		    relief.’ But such an account is ‘the child of a medical profession which for a long time would accept nothing less as the basis for hormonal or surgical invention,’ with Rose telling the amusing, distressing, revealing anecdote that ‘in the
		    1960s, the profiles of candidates for medical transition were found to be strangely in harmony with Harry Benjamin’s then definitive textbook on the subject: “strangely,” until it was realised that all of them had been reading it and brushing up
		    their lines.’<small><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></small> Spott writes ‘Dysmorphia/dysphoria dysphorically morphed,’<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> vacillating from body dysmorphia to gender dysphoria and
		    back again in the language of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which continues to classify the first as a mental disorder even if no longer the second. Sandy Stone writes of the way in which Gender Identity Clinics
		    enforced traditional masculine or feminine behaviour as a prerequisite to treatment, manifesting as the erasure of ‘any intervening space in the continuum of sexuality’ in trans* memoir.’<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small>
		    As Jacques points out, this was ‘a protocol designed, perhaps, to protect cisgender people from exposure to transitioners’, which also ‘formed the basis of radical feminist claims that transsexual people (especially transsexual women) were dupes
		    of the patriarchy who willingly conformed to outdated stereotypes.’<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small>&nbsp;Spott rejects the idea that either terminal in the dualistic continuum undergirding these narratives is stable:
		    ‘“Trans*” supposes transition, but where is that transition from and to’<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> when ‘determined as it is by a start and a finish, a false double’?<small><a href="#_ftn24"
		        name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small>&nbsp;Spott here anticipates Jack Halberstam’s recent injunction to reconsider the asterisk as a Boolean that ‘modifies the meaning of transitivity by refusing to situate transition in relation to a
		    destination, a final form, a specific shape, or an established configuration of desire and identity.’<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> Associating it with the teleological ‘theology […] of Calvin, Arminius or Molina,’
		    Spott professes to have ‘moved away’ from a concept of transition due to the way it fits into a paradigm of medical gatekeeping violently depicted throughout the <i>Manifestos </i>as a silver light, skewing the theological association between
		    light and knowledge. The image of ‘Lips over- / bitten, the horrible silver light,, / open / to in our side’ ends the collection’s first fragmentary section, sentences broken and legible only in the sense of their violation. Spott figures light
		    as the sterile and violent medical gaze, a tunnelling vision or sight as stream of light glinting like a shard of glass or a shaft of steel as it punctures the side of the subject, our (in) side. Even to describe what is happening here strains
		    language, the passage’s jarring pronouns and prepositions clear only in the brunt of its strained, pained affect. In the <i>Manifestos</i> ‘your death’ becomes ‘his report,’ and sense-making becomes ‘stupid and venomous cohesion.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> Scientific understanding is not innocuous and objective, but filled with violent rage; ‘the stupidity of silver light is frothing.’<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small><br>
		    <br></p></div>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="spott"><i>Of the many narratives that she was made to speak that night, the ones that felt the most invasive were those that gestured towards the medical. Because it was at these moments that the prurience with which the questioner
		        asked her questions was most visible, in the relentless discursive working through of bodies and biology. It gradually became clear that there was no satisfactory narrative, or rather that none of these narratives would satiate the questioner
		        and resolve her questions. Her questions, implicit in all that she was saying, being ‘Are you who you say you are? Do you exist in the way you believe yourself to exist? Your reality - is it real?’ The salacious demand for a churning
		        procession of stories had nothing to do with gaining knowledge, and everything to do with the pleasure of watching a body perform under duress.</i><br></div>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="para"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one respond to the call to justify yourself? For, as Spott makes clear, it’s not just scientific legibility but linguistic legibility that threatens the trans* subject: ‘This violence (all violence) is allowed by, in spite of
		    and because of language.’<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> Susan Stryker, although unable to escape ‘phallogocentric language,’ hopes to ‘move furiously enough’ to ‘deform it’ with ‘a trace of [her] rage.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> Similarly, one tactic Spott deploys is a call to violent illegibility: ‘Do not speak in words. Do not write them. Do not give your children names.’ These are perhaps unreasonable demands, but
		    what they really express is the sentence that follows them: ‘No.’<small><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> These instructions are an attempt at rejection, rejection of the necessity of having to explain oneself that justifies the
		    dynamic in which, somehow, people ‘believe themselves qualified to legislate on the reality, or not, of anyone else, without claiming divine authority (or worse).’<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> Spott radicalises
		    Serano’s injunction to ‘stop projecting what we wish were true about gender and sexuality onto other people, and instead learn to yield to their unique individual identities, experiences, and perspectives,’<small><a href="#_ftn32"
		        name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small> demonstrating the danger in projecting a stable or coherent identity even onto ourselves: ‘<i>I am who I am </i>is a violence.’<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> Instead, and it’s
		    worth noting that the first manifesto was originally published the summer after the Occupy Movement,<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> Spott calls for ‘occupation,’ not ‘transition,’ with the metaphor of ‘staying still’ in
		    ‘the <i>through </i>space.’ A through space is, by definition, a space ‘you’re supposed to be “moving” through,’ and so paradoxically ‘refusing mobility’ in it ‘is what really fucks up the paradigm.’ This resists a teleological justification, or
		    any self-identification which forecloses possibility. Transitory space, elided by palatable wrong-body narratives, is deliberately occupied as an antagonist act of ‘discomfort for THEM and not US.’<small><a href="#_ftn35"
		        name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small> Spott’s tools in conveying this incomprehensible space are words used against themselves: Spott describes her project as ‘trying to […] establish a language space that deliberately alienates anyone and
		    anything that enforces the gender binary.’<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> All of the texts in the collection, including the ones that appear to be pure prose, resist easy comprehension: pronominal referents are withheld
		    in a reflection of English-language discourse’s fundamental reliance on gender signification, arcane references are made to obscure figures such as Antiochus IV, words are misspelled or newly coined, and syntax is consistently fractured or
		    warped. The images conjured by ‘A Hex, on Justice,’ the most caustic of the manifestos, are offensive or impossible to imagine: the speaker spits sarcastically of ‘the magnificent things that are done in the name of justice,’ listing the extreme
		    cruelty of the James Bulger case alongside ‘Fifa, enforced Hellenism,’ and the seemingly invented ‘Patriarchs of Triton.’<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> These juxtaposed words resist any attempt to impose a cohesive
		    argument or narratological connection. It’s difficult to imagine a reader who would not be alienated by this; if ‘the “trans community” is as confused as its components,’<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> these texts are
		    clearly uninterested in resolving that confusion.<br>
		    <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;Who, then, do the <i>Manifestos</i> address? The pronoun ‘you’ is used throughout, sometimes in an indefinite sense and oftentimes as a seemingly direct second person pronoun. Furthermore, it’s unclear whether the texts are aimed at
		    those inside or outside the ‘trans* community,’ a term it treats suspiciously. One way in which the text appears to address trans* people is in ‘Fluidity,’ in which Spott discusses the metaphor of gender fluidity commonly associated with Kate
		    Bornstein’s influential text <i>Gender Outlaw</i>,<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> and implies an intracommunity conversation through the suggestion that ‘we’ go beyond this metaphoric paradigm.<small><a href="#_ftn40"
		        name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> On the other hand the previous page rages against its addressee, referencing venomous transphobic ‘spew’ emerging ‘from the back of your larynx,’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small>
		    while ‘Against Transition’ appears to be apostrophising the term ‘transition’ itself.<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> This shifting address allows Spott to situate herself in relation to the three waves of <i>écriture
		      trans,</i> which Juliet Jacques delineates as transsexual memoirs which ‘spent most of their energy justifying their existences to outsiders,’ followed by a second wave that ‘had aimed largely to build a community’ of ‘trans people talking to
		    each other in an unprecedented way’ and a third wave with ‘a strong focus on media representation.’<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> Spott, in expressing the dangers of visibility and representation, cannot be situated
		    simply in the current, third wave of <i>écriture trans</i>. Instead she problematises questions of audience, asking who is involved in this conversation on each side, and why. <br></p></div>
		    <br>
		    <i> </i><br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="spott"><i>Although I shared in the protracted tension of that night, and although I did, eventually, intervene, the conversation that I witnessed, and in which these abstract questions of identity and gender made their material weight
		        felt, is not my story. My story is the story of a person watching a conversation play out before them as if behind a glass screen, a conversation echoing the one they’ve been having in their head for a long time. At first, while the
		        conversation remained seemingly good-natured, I was desperate to be involved. Don’t you realise, I wanted to ask, that the questions you ask are the questions I ask myself daily? Your interrogation is the one I imagine I’ll encounter every
		        time I enter an unknown environment, a space of strangers. But I don’t, or at least I don’t very often. Perhaps it’s because I’m not trying hard enough, although it’s unclear what I’d have to aim for to successfully ‘pass’ as non-binary, and
		        perhaps it’s to do with the way in which a patriarchal society is determined that what it codes as female it also codes as artificial: femininity as a contrived costume I take off at the end of the day.</i><small><a href="#_ftn44"
		          name="_ftnref44" class="spott">[44]</a></small><i> That night I felt the privilege, and it’s no coincidence that I was presumed to be a cisgender male, of being a supposedly objective observer of a purportedly controversial existence made
		        subject to theoretical debate. Watching these two women talk, following their arguments, silently examining and moving their words around in my head on the other side of the room with impeccable critical distance, I thought not only about
		        myself but about the writing of essays. Who gets to speak, and how?</i><br></div>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="para"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose tells us that, reading trans* narratives, she ‘felt the range of utterances the trans person is permitted narrow into a stranglehold.’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small> The <i>Manifestos’</i> voice is
		    restrained, in a grip particularly apparent in the shape of the poetic fragments. On page five, reproduced at the end of this essay as appendix one, a comma drifts outwards from the full stop that precedes it, followed by the word ‘spoiled.’ What
		    subject, or presence, or absence is spoiled? It seems to be ‘the person’, with what ‘seems’ their ‘little life.’ Spoiled, how? The following lines appear linked not linearly but associatively in multiple directions: ‘returning to,’ while followed
		    by ‘hold’ is closer to ‘mother, father,’ with the clasping grip and the parents both equidistant from ‘falling out’ which, using italics to push through the stillness of the austere and stifling whiteness of the page, is shown to be a falling out
		    ‘<i>from </i>the world.’ These words’ relation to the space is not one of free-floating looseness, but ‘tight, it / assembled.’<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small>&nbsp;These components are assembled disparately by force, a
		    strangled speech both excessive and restricted, the voice of the ‘frightened body’ in relation to the ‘laws, connections, and even structures of meaning’ which ‘govern and condition’ it.<small><a href="#_ftn47"
		        name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small>&nbsp;The prose of pages eleven to thirteen, ‘Trans* Manifesto – Revisited,’ originally appeared in Spott’s blog along with the poem of page fifteen, reproduced here as appendix two, with no gap or break
		    between the two.<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> The same themes, the same terms, feature in both parts, but the poem’s ‘Paradise, this shit’ is more aggressive than the prose, which features ‘Paradise/’ as a kind of
		    hesitant anti-heading in a slightly smaller typeface. The unnerving narrative of the spirrim<small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> transition, a strange supernatural body-switching procedure, reappears within a poetics of
		    restraint, the ‘Cut in the side of the body head to foot’ is ‘wrought’ as ‘ideals to body split,’ a violent material clashing between thought and body, the split occurring not from but ‘to’ the body. The ‘Waist / unbecoming’ renders the body both
		    improper and undoing. A paradoxical ‘I-not’ pronoun is introduced and ‘bodied,’ before an isolated ‘ec’ prefix from the Greek meaning out of, out, outside, away from, figures the broken movement of the subject: ‘ec / completely.’ The ‘I-not’
		    becomes ‘eye’ becomes ‘I-does,’ a shifting register of subject positions.<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> Spott introduces the collection as ‘nearly all improvisations, written in moments of stress and tension,’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> and the way in which these fragments make sense affectively as the suppression’s embodiment asks us to consider what role we play as reader of this pained and painful expression, challenges us
		    to come to terms with what the <i>Trans* Manifestos</i> is asking of us.<br></p></div>
		    <br>
		    <i> </i><br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="spott"><i>Why, then, speak of this? Or, why do I want to? No matter how firmly I believe in the absurdity of asking another person to justify their existence, I still find myself wanting to be asked: to tell people, the people close
		        to me and the people that I meet. Because if I didn’t say it, would it still be true? I want the answer to be yes, but there’s something about speaking an identity, making it visible and present in words, that makes it feel real in a
		        different way. Perhaps I knew from the start the risk of an explanation. Looking back at the message with which I first told my best friend, I see the insistence on nothing being different: ‘this won’t really result in many (/any?) changes to
		        anything, I don’t think […] this is in some ways a pretty big non-event.’ So why did I need to tell him? And the question I’m most afraid of being asked - why bother? Can’t you do the things you want to do, be the person you want to be, as a
		        man? Because, of course, I could. But of course I couldn’t. Because of course I can’t. If this doesn’t make sense, and it doesn’t, then in what sense am I trying to explain my self?</i><br></div>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    <div class="para"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying what the <i>Trans* Manifestos</i> ask of us is one way of working out why they speak. Because despite their relentless distrust in ‘trying to explain,’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> the
		    <i>Manifestos</i>, while alienating, are not insular: the material is freely available on the author’s blog, and this year they were republished by Pilot Press alongside additional material written since 2017 as <i>Prayers, Manifestos,
		      Bravery</i>. In ‘I Never Said that I was Brave,’ Spott explicitly asks the reader to ‘listen, dear friend, listen to our weaponised bodies. Listen how they howl, how they are mocked and disassembled.’<small><a href="#_ftn53"
		        name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> A universal tension exists in an acute way for trans* people: as Rose writes, ‘no human can survive without recognition […] A transsexual person merely brings that act to the surface, exposing the latent
		    violence lurking behind the banal truth of our dependency on other people.’<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> The <i>Manifestos</i> are aware of this in Spott’s struggle to situate gender among ‘actions, events and
		    patterns’ all with ‘the propensity to shift,’ asking ‘how many of these smaller components create the entire motion? What are their names? Where are they being held? What are the demands for their release?’<small><a href="#_ftn55"
		        name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small> The tricky question of gender’s location is exemplified in Spott’s ironic image of perfect gender performance through enacting ‘the prescribed order of symbols, events, behaviours &amp; motions.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small>&nbsp;Gender exists here between prescription and enactment, as ‘heteroglossia and trembles.’<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small> One thing the <i>Manifestos</i> resolutely
		    refuses to be is a proclamation of an identity, an ‘I am who I am.’<small><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a></small> This is because, as Lucy Freedman argues, ‘identification is only a tiny part of what gender is’ when ‘to <i>be
		      gendered</i> is a process which occurs externally’ due to ‘the power of external definition’ in contemporary society.<small><a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></small> Spott’s resistance to self-identification understands that ‘identity
		    is more often something etched onto us, rather than something we ourselves have the agency to adopt, mould or reject.’<small><a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></small> In pointing instead to the way in which the trans* subject is
		    fundamentally ‘confounded by the impossibility laid out by the primal stupidity of language,’<small><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a></small> and that the ‘observable’ and the ‘describable’ are ‘exponentially tenuous,’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></small> Spott brings the way in which gendering operates into question. Freedman doesn’t note that stating an identity is an illocutionary act which can affect the way in which one is externally
		    gendered, the power of which is tied subsequently to race, class, and dis/ability. If gendering currently operates externally to the gendered subject, and is based upon the authority of phallogocentric language, then the political procedure Spott
		    manifests here is loosening the supposed sense of gendered signifiers in order to allow a freedom of movement. As she writes in ‘Pronoun Manifesto,’ ‘corrected pronouns are transitional demands towards a full comprehension &amp; abandonment of
		    every system of naming.’<small><a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a></small> This is a tactical move, for <i>Trans* Manifestos</i> is also a text of tactics.<br>
		    <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;The tactical basis of this text can be found by asking what the <i>Manifestos</i> can do for the people they are for. The text pretends to offer ‘some coping strategies,’ such as ‘imagining that you were originally hollow’ and
		    ‘repeating the same actions over and over again.’<small><a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a></small> The <i>Manifestos</i>’ final section, ‘Gender Dysphoria,’ makes clear why coping strategies are sarcastically rejected. The tone shifts
		    from the violent rage of the preceding piece, ‘A Hex, on Justice,’ to calm tranquillity: in a lulling perfect tense the speaker has ‘wandered’ into and out of a room with ease, has ‘sat on the grass, slept a little. Fell quiet.’ Although there
		    are unidentified ‘figures’ in the scene they are distant and non-threatening, avoided by ducking ‘down into the long grass, where I crawled around, joyous.’ Yet underneath this sleepy fantasy is a lesson about ‘the satisfaction of detachment,’ a
		    warning emerging like the ‘blood’ and ‘scabs’ under the ‘blissful […] itching’ of a scratch.<small><a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a></small> Entering the doctor’s room, the speaker admits to a total lack of agency: ‘I found my lips were
		    moving and I was speaking[,] reciting’ an extensive list of medical conditions.<small><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a></small> The piece ends with the spirrim operation happening to the speaker, holding ‘the silver light’ themselves
		    and stating ‘I have Gender Dysphoria.’<small><a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a></small> A diagnosis of gender dysphoria is one of the current conditions of gender confirmation surgery; what Spott portrays here is a person relinquishing
		    themselves to a medical authority. Instead of submissively coping with what ‘does not please me,’ the text advocates for resistance: ‘when I ensure what does not please me occurs no more.’ Spott evokes resistance in the language of striking, as
		    ‘the act of a deliberate stopping’ which can only be understood relationally, as against the ‘system of deliberate and continued […] exploitation’ and ‘policing’ which ‘is its opposite.’<small><a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a></small>
		    Freedman warns of the way in which ‘a new social capital begins to emerge based on the ability to articulate one’s own suffering,’<small><a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[69]</a></small> and the <i>Manifestos</i> appropriately refuse to create
		    an identity out of their pain. Instead the text follows Nat Raha, to whom the <i>Manifestos</i> are dedicated, arguing trans* brokenness must be politicised ‘as part of social and material injustice that must be transformed.’<small><a
		        href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70">[70]</a></small><br>
		    <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;This ‘isn’t a transition it’s a fucking apocalypse.’<small><a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71">[71]</a></small> For that which confounds and in return is confounded by trans* is ‘the impossibility laid out by the primal stupidity of
		    language, of bourgeois life and of protocol.’<small><a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72">[72]</a></small> In being made responsible for the failing of language, the trans* subject asked to explain themselves is in a unique position to expose that
		    failing. Spott tells us ‘I don’t want allies. I want accomplices,’<small><a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73">[73]</a></small> and this text is our accomplice in that exposure. It offers the ‘mutual support that inaugurates a more livable world and
		    calls for the transformation of the material conditions that fracture and break us’;<small><a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74">[74]</a></small> it provides ‘ligatures for living,’<small><a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75">[75]</a></small> at the
		    same time as it utters its ‘blatant hex.’<small><a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76">[76]</a></small> Halberstam warns of ‘trying to fight power by battling over the relations between signifiers and signifieds while leaving the structures of
		    signification itself intact,’<small><a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77">[77]</a></small> and accordingly Spott attacks these structures. ‘The binary enforced in all characters of language, likes. It <i>likes</i> the body (and is like) dead animal,
		    dual carriageway,’<small><a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78">[78]</a></small> in that language operates by likening things, erasing their fundamental unlikeness, which is how it ‘enforce[s] stupefaction.’<small><a href="#_ftn79"
		        name="_ftnref79">[79]</a></small> Trans* means confronting the violence of language, and for that reason works upon a uniquely vulnerable pressure point in the processes of identity. Stryker tells us that ‘to apprehend a transgendered
		    consciousness articulating itself, is to risk a revelation of the constructedness of the natural order,’<small><a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80">[80]</a></small>&nbsp;challenging us to ‘discover the seams and sutures’ in ourselves.<small><a
		        href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81">[81]</a></small> Look: the <i>Trans* Manifestos</i> ‘is also the fact of the seam bursting.’<small><a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82">[82]</a></small><br></p></div>
