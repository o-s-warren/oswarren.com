		<h3>
		<br>Introduction</h3><br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly halfway through the intricate narrative of Thomas Pynchon’s 1966 novel <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, protagonist Oedipa Mass asks ‘shall I project a world?’<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> The question is central to what remains, for Pierre-Yves Petillon, ‘the most emblematic text of the American sixties’,<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> a text documenting what was felt to be the dawning of a new kind of radical community, a moment of ‘liberation’ in which ‘anything was possible’ and ‘nothing could stand in the way of such joyous certainty’.<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> That second quotation is from <i>Vineland</i>, Pynchon’s second novel set in California, which I would argue has a far clearer understanding of the sixties and is the key text of this dissertation. <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> is a firmly established pinnacle of 20th-century American literature: both ‘the most frequently translated of Pynchon’s works’ and a staple ‘of college and university courses in contemporary American fiction’.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> <i>Vineland</i> shares little of Pynchon’s general acclaim: it was published to ‘a cool critical reception’ in 1990, after ‘seventeen years of relative silence’ from Pynchon following the monolithic <i>Gravity’s Rainbow</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small><i>Vineland</i> was immediately criticised as ‘more manageable’<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> than ‘its predecessor […] in style, content, and scope’,<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small> yet in later years has come to be recognised as ‘a meditation on the American social reality’ demanding to be considered on its own terms.<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in 1984, <i>Vineland</i> concerns characters Neil Brooks describes as ‘a diverse group of survivors of the 1960s’ as they recount and remember the failure and co-option of a Californian student movement.<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> Brooks’ term ‘survivors’ is apt: TV-addicted D.E.A. field agent Hector Zuñiga asks ‘who was saved?’ (<i>VL</i> 29) by ‘you sixties people’ (<i>VL</i> 28). N. Katherine Hayles answers that ‘obvious to everyone is the failure of the sixties to solve the problems the radical movement shouted to the nation – poverty, racism, American economic and military imperialism’.<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> Instead, ‘the only candidates’ saved were ‘those who fought for the revolution’,<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> and accordingly the novel follows the relatively small scale search for former activist Frenesi Gates by her ex-husband and estranged teenage daughter Zoyd and Prairie Wheeler. As Joanna Freer notes, ‘historically Pynchon criticism has based itself primarily on analysis of the writing’s postmodern qualities’ with ‘little to say on social or political issues’.<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> It is only in the last ten years that the field has tended towards an examination of Pynchon’s politics and ethics and, although Samuel Thomas has recognised that ‘the experience of the sixties functions as the most significant juncture in Pynchon’s political universe’,<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> <i>Vineland</i> has been left relatively understudied in comparison to Pynchon’s more dominant works. I argue, then, for a reconsideration of <i>Vineland</i> as indicative of a changing cultural and political awareness inextricable from the legacy of the sixties.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;This dissertation asks: how does Thomas Pynchon’s understanding of the radical potential of the American sixties change between <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> and <i>Vineland</i>, and what does the change tell us about the possibility of politics at the end of the 20th century? Firstly, I aim to chart a pessimistic trajectory between <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> and <i>Vineland</i> through a combination of close readings and an examination of various critical responses to Pynchon. Chapter One interrogates a general scholarly consensus towards <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>’s political possibility through a framework that brings to light already-present aspects that would later become problematic. These inherent flaws are the basis of Chapter Two, in which <i>Vineland </i>is read as a response to and extension of <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>. Both that earlier novel and the cultural-political moment it purported to capture are reinscribed with the deep gloom of a much wearier worldview, through a series of close readings that aim to show the extent to which complicity and co-option are defining traits of a system that has become total.<br>
		 <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aim is to salvage something from within Pynchon’s pessimism, though bringing the author into conversation with the philosophy of Theodor Adorno. As I will demonstrate, despite their surface differences the two thinkers can be productively aligned in a way that defends Pynchon from critiques of hopelessness and impotence, critiques which Adorno incorporated into his philosophical project. Adorno’s thought has been described as ‘remarkably stable’ across the course of his career, possessing a ‘startling inner coherence’,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> and thus I will be referencing a wide range of Adorno’s works in order to both acknowledge and demonstrate their consistency. In creating a dialogue between Adorno and Pynchon, I hope to show Pynchon’s changing viewpoint as not only necessary but exceptionally honest regarding the struggles which politics, art, and praxis face at the close of the twentieth century. The dissertation concludes with remarks gesturing towards potential further directions of study, and an appeal to the relevance of both thinkers for our contemporary moment.<br>
