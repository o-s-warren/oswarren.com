		  <p><i>We blow up cinema<br>
		For<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; CINEMA<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be seen<br></i>
		    &nbsp; - Dziga Vertov, The Laboratory of Hearing (1917)</p><br><br>

		<p>Dziga Vertov got his start at age 21 working for the <i>Kino-Nedelya</i> Soviet newsreel, thundering across the Russian landscape via ’agit-train’ and recording, editing, and projecting ideological support to Red Army soldiers on the front-lines of the Russian Civil War. Fearlessness is the central aspect of Vertov’s work: from the very beginning of his career, David Kaufman (as he was known before changing his name to the Ukrainian for ‘spinning top’) expressed his fervent dedication to revolutionary ideals through a concerted effort to demolish the outer limits of cinema. 1929’s <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i>, created by ‘Author-Supervisor of the Experiment’ Vertov in collaboration with his wife Elizaveta Svilova and his brother Mikhail Kaufman, depicts a single day in the life of an unnamed Soviet city across seventy minutes and almost two thousand shots; that the shots tend towards a couple of seconds only goes some way in explaining how Vertov manages to encompass marriage, divorce, birth, and death all within a three-minute sequence halfway through the film. Part of the key to understanding how Vertov’s irrepressible dynamism comes packaged with a coherent obedience to the Leninist party line is his sense of filmic reality: this was a man whose mission in life was to abolish all non-documentary filmmaking (which he called ‘poison for the eyes’), and also a man that pioneered (among other techniques) multiple exposures, reversed footage, and stop motion in order to achieve this aim.</p>
		  <br>
		<p>In the film’s opening titles, a prelude-as-manifesto which serves as the film’s sole use of language, the viewer is told that ‘this experimental work aims at creating a truly international absolute language of cinema based on its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature.’ Over ninety years later this still comes as a shock: not merely no actors and no set, but an attempt to irrevocably break with those forms with which cinema’s vocabulary is still entangled. Vertov had already been grasping towards a purely cinematic art with <i>Kino-Pravda</i> (Film Truth), the newsreel series he founded with Svilova in 1922 in which he honed his camera trickery as a method of ideological truthfulness, a more perceptive eye. The eye ws a central metaphor for Vertov and his companions (who referred to themselves as ‘Kinoks,’ or ‘cinema-eye men’); the filmmaker spoke often of the fact that the camera’s eye can be developed and perfected, a machine that can climb anything and go anywhere. It isn’t merely a mechanical apparatus that records reality more objectively than anything else (although Vertov’s obsession with technological advancement can easily lead viewers to assume he believes so), but rather a machine in dialectical relation to the human eye, both extending its capabilities and teaching it to look in a new way.</p>

		<p>Because of this, a question that arises often while watching <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i> is the politics of trickery. The Kinoks used sleight of hand when they wanted to to film ‘life as it is’;  this included using telephoto lenses, disguising themselves as electricians, and diverting attention to a dummy camera so that any mugging wouldn’t break the fourth wall. Early critics felt they saw through these dazzling effects, which Eisenstein called ‘pointless camera hooliganism,’ as a kind of contentless formalism. Yet Vertov’s prolific writings point to a different understanding of cinematic innovation: a Constructivist at heart, Vertov’s 1922 ‘We: Variant of a Manifesto’ glorifies ‘electricity’s unerring ways’ and ‘saws dancing at a sawmill.’ The passages in which Vertov conceives of a path ‘through the poetry of machines, from the bungling citizen to the perfect electric man’ are somewhat hard to stomach today, but Vertov takes enough from the Transcendentalism of his favourite poet Walt Whitman’s ‘I Sing the Body Electric’ to resist a cold machine-fetishism, and <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i>’s exuberant enthusiasm encompasses both switchboards and their operators. Unlike Eisenstein, and in fact unlike almost anyone else inside or outside of Russia in the 1920s, Vertov’s method of montage rejects the hierarchical technique of literary metaphor; Vertov’s juxtapositions are allusive rather than analogous, exploring correspondence without recourse to tenor and vehicle or using one thing to explain or express another. In aligning the motion of people  with the music of machinery Vertov doesn’t want to industrialise the human senses, but instead use cinema as a tool to ‘introduce creative joy into all mechanical labor’ and ‘bring people into closer kinship’ with the machines they were using to fashion the future under the first five-year plan.</p>

		<p>That rapid industrialisation of 1928 to 1932 is the key touchstone of <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i>. The kinoks insisted that cinema was a crucial part of industry and revolution, and were keen to stress how the creative production of cinema was itself a form of labour. Putting him at odds with the prevailing attitudes under Stalin, Vertov rejected both Socialist Realism's emphasis on reflection of society and the idea of cinema as a diversionary entertainment for leisure time. <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i> foregrounds the work of cinema: Mikhail Kaufman tirelessly operating the hand-cranked camera while performing deaf-defying stunts. Editing is just as central to the production process, and accordingly Svilova’s magical feats of reality-shaping are tendered through a close attention to the concrete processes of hand and eye in 35mm film editing (one of the many reasons the film was championed by structuralist filmmakers in the sixties and seventies). Film, Vertov maintained, should be a central aspect of the Soviet industrialisation plans, with a concerted focus on what Kaufman called ‘the creation of an image-oriented journalism’ using the new capabilities of film to their highest potential. It was obvious to them that the future human would be filmic - the Kinoks were historical materialists, and film would be a key means of production. Vertov and his collaborators weren't only interested in 'life as it is' but also 'life caught unawares,' life when surprised or provoked by the presence of the camera. Their understanding of the camera’s very involvement with and shaping of the reality it records makes <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i> so relevant to contemporary experience, the way it transgresses the border between observer and observed in a prefiguration of how the metaphysics of looking and spectacle would play out across the twentieth century. Although Vertov didn’t realise his dreams, unable to achieve his dream of incorporating cinema into industry and eventually falling foul of his undeserved reputation as an elitist and a formalist, <i>Man with a Movie Camera</i> remains as a testament to the once insuppressible enthusiasm of those revolutionary years.</p>
