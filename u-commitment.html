		  Against Committed Art: Adorno and Utopian Negativity
		</h3>
		<br>
		<div class="para"><p>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1962, Theodor Adorno presented ‘Commitment’, first as a broadcast on Radio Bremen and then as an article in the <i>Neue Rundschau</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></small> In it, Adorno responds to Jean-Paul Sartre’s <i>What is Literature?</i>, translated into German earlier that year,<small><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></small> alongside an extended critique of Bertolt Brecht’s aesthetic praxis. In conjunction with his remarks on modernist literature and music, Adorno’s comments serve to delineate a strict rejection of art ‘committed’ to a political or philosophical message as less politically potent than art ‘autonomous’ in content.<small><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></small> In critiquing committed art, Adorno argues for the privileged position of autonomous art as negatively utopian, a sole enclave of paradoxical resistance against late capitalism’s totality.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Before elucidating his disagreements, it’s important to recognise that Adorno sets out a foundation of agreement regarding a shared contextual crisis of art, as urgent as ‘anything that merely concerns the life of the mind can be’.<small><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></small> In <i>What is Literature?</i>, Sartre intends to answer a set of broad questions including ‘Why Write?’<small><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></small> and ‘For Whom Does One Write?’.<small><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></small> Sartre argues that, in literature, ‘the writer deals with meanings’<small><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></small>: his task, in an ‘appeal to the freedom’<small><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></small>of his readers, is ‘to reveal the world’ so that humanity ‘may assume full responsibility before the object which has been thus laid bare’.<small><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></small> In other words Sartre champions the freedom of both author and readers, and maintains faith in the ability, with this freedom, for the essence of things to be truthfully conveyed. This preoccupation with the conveying of meanings underlies Sartre’s preference for prose over poetry: ‘Prose is, in essence, utilitarian’ since the prose-writer ‘<i>makes use</i> of words’.<small><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></small> Words, for Sartre, are tools for the committed writer’s task of demonstrating, designating, persuading and insinuating.<small><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></small> In ‘Commitment’, Adorno tells us ‘Sartre was moved to issue his manifesto’ because he recognised a certain feature of his historical situation which Adorno also takes to be true: the relegation of art’s function to ‘optional edification’, with artworks being treated as ‘cultural commodities’.<small><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></small> Such a carnivorous relationship with art is, as Adorno details in his <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, a false one: ‘For him who has a genuine relation to art, in which he himself vanishes, art is not an object’ for ‘devouring’, something for which ‘a balance sheet could be drawn up’.<small><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></small> The situation which Adorno credits Sartre with recognising is due, as he and Horkheimer argue in <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, to the ‘whole world’ being ‘made to pass though the filter of the culture industry’,<small><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></small> in which products are industrially produced for mass consumption. Adorno’s explanation of cultural commodification therefore rests on a recognition of capitalism’s totality, which forms the basis of his philosophical critique of Sartre.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Adorno’s attack on Sartre’s support for committed art is one rooted in philosophical difference. Adorno begins by attacking Sartre’s conception of isolated ‘meaning’,<small><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></small> for which Sartre believes art should be used as a vehicle. Adorno agrees that ‘[o]f course’ the writer deals with meanings, ‘but not only with them’, for meaning, or content, cannot be separated from form: ‘no literary work, not even the traditional novel’ leaves the meanings of words ‘unaltered, as they were outside of it’.<small><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></small> Adorno’s conception of meaning as unequivocally affected by form is rooted in modernist theory: Ezra Pound states in his <i>ABC of Reading</i> that ‘literature is language charged with meaning’<small><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></small> whilst contending that ‘meaning is not a set, cut-off thing’.<small><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></small> Adorno also equates Sartre’s demand that art should ‘say something’ with the bourgeois notion that art is required to give you something, to make a return on your investment.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Finally, he accuses Sartre of attempting ‘simply a communication of his own philosophy’ in his own committed artworks.<small><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></small> This, Adorno tells us in <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, is not art, for ‘[a]rtworks that unfold to contemplation and thought without any remainder are not artworks’.<small><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></small> As a mere mouthpiece of philosophy, committed art loses its status as art and therefore the unique truth-content that Adorno will expand upon in his discussion of Beckett and Kafka.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;First, however, Adorno complements his demonstration of Sartre’s committed art as philosophically invalid with a critique of Brecht’s politically invalid committed art. Adorno has some praise for Brecht, ‘more consistent than Sartre and a greater artist’.<small><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></small> However, Brecht still shares Sartre’s disdain for mediations, mediations Adorno argues are ‘innumerable’ in political truth.<small><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></small> Brecht attempts to represent the essences of social forces, forgetting that, as Adorno cites from Hegel’s <i>Science of Logic</i>, ‘essence must appear’.<small><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></small> Adorno writes that if Hegel is right, then ‘a representation of essence which ignores its relation to appearance must be as intrinsically false as the substitution of a lumpen-proletariat for the men behind fascism’,<small><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></small> a reference to Brecht’s <i>The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui</i>. That play’s allegory between Chicago gangsters and the Third Reich comes under particular criticism as bad politics, for it treats both tenor and vehicle as ‘extra-territorial’.<small><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></small> The historical reality of the gangs of Chicago is exploited as a hollow vehicle, whilst comparing the Third Reich to buffoonish gangsters results in ‘the true horror of fascism’, that it was no ‘accident’, being ‘conjured away’.<small><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;Part of Adorno’s rejection of committed art is dependent on the horror of both the Holocaust and the ensuing form of life on an earth that, as he and Horkheimer memorably contend, ‘radiates disaster triumphant’.<small><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></small> Adorno declares that ‘to write lyric poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’,<small><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></small> a repetition of a 1951 dictum that he would repeat and revise up to the publication of <i>Negative Dialectics</i>.<small><a href="_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></small> In demonstration of this point, he argues that ‘the so-called artistic representation’ of the Holocaust ‘contains, however remotely, the power to elicit enjoyment out of it’.<small><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></small> Adorno is particularly pessimistic in this section of the essay, and rightfully so: he perceptively identifies an ambivalent relationship between pain and pleasure in commemorating tragedy, in which ‘the sound of despair’ pays ‘tribute to a hideous affirmation’.<small><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></small>&nbsp;Even greatly critical commemorative artwork serves to strengthen ‘the culture that gave birth to murder’ by becoming part of a soothingly self-flagellating cultural heritage.<small><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></small> The state of the world Adorno describes doubles back on his criticism of Sartre, for it makes Sartre’s faith in the communicative possibilities of traditional forms absurd against a now fragmented and hollow existence. As Adorno argues in ‘Trying to Understand<i> Endgame’</i>, ‘[d]rama cannot simply seize on to negative meaning, or its absence, as content, without thereby affecting everything peculiar to it’.<small><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></small> That Sartre thinks meaninglessness can be conveyed as meaning once was reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of meaninglessness and the state of the world properly evoked by <i>Endgame</i>’s playwright Samuel Beckett’s ‘moribund grotesques’.<small><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></small><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;It is Beckett, along with Kafka, who displays the appropriate response to <i>Minima Moralia</i>’s ‘world that has turned abstract’,<small><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></small> a world itself ‘indigent and distorted’.<small><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></small> Adorno sets out early in ‘Commitment’ that it ‘is not the office of art to spotlight alternatives, but to resist by its form alone the course of the world’,<small><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></small> and it is with the modernists that Adorno explains the second half of this formulation. Adorno refers to abstraction in art as a response ‘to the abstraction of the law which objectively dominates society’,<small><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></small> which, as Simon Jarvis points out, means Beckett and Kafka still perform ‘a kind of mimesis’ but a ‘mimesis of the systematic framework which impoverishes experience’.<small><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></small> Adorno rejects Brecht’s attempt to convey the essence of social relations; he accepts Beckett’s for, in Simon Critchley’s phrase, Beckett succeeds ‘by elevating social criticism to the level of form.’<small><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></small> The ‘indignation of philistines’<small><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></small> such works may inspire is due to the misconception that life and experience remain suitably rich for the realism of past generations. Instead we must face what Jarvis calls ‘a realism of the loss of experience’.<small><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></small> While this pessimism seems perhaps an exaggeration, it’s important to understand that for Adorno ‘exaggeration seems […] a necessary medium for social-theoretical and philosophical presentation’, since ‘moderate, normal surface existence in general conceals […] the threat lying below it’ in a way that ‘always’ colours the straightforward statement of that threat with ‘the character of exaggeration’.<small><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></small> Besides, Adorno’s pessimism contains its opposite, particularly in the case of his rejection of committed art. Art, Adorno recognises, is autonomous. However, art emerges from society. The paradoxical nature of art comes together in <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>’s formulation that ‘[a]rt is the social antithesis of society’<small><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></small>: Adorno privileges art as, unlike anything else, being both of and not of society. Committed art loses its autonomous character when it bends to the whims of a philosophical or political invective, and loses its character as art when it is reducible to thought ‘without remainder’.<small><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></small> Adorno therefore rejects committed art, for it is in the paradoxical double character of autonomous art that the utopian moment of his thought emerges. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp;When Adorno repeats his dictum about the impossibility of lyric poetry after Auschwitz, he’s careful to state that he has ‘no wish to soften the saying’.<small><a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></small> His caution is due to the fact that he paradoxically accompanies it with the insistence ‘that literature must resist this verdict’.<small><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></small> Adorno’s reasoning is that art’s ‘own situation is one of paradox’, <small><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></small> not only of its status as the social antithesis of society but in how it both cannot and must exist after Auschwitz: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on’, in the words of Beckett’s <i>The Unnamable</i>.<small><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></small> But this position is what allows art to point to a truly alternative possibility. Adorno was heavily influenced by Ernst Bloch’s <i>The</i> <i>Spirit of Utopia</i>, which argues that ‘thought serves hope’,<small><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></small> that all cognition voices a prayer: ‘May it truly be thus!’<small><a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></small> As Jarvis paraphrases, knowledge for Bloch is ‘not simply a contemplative description of what exists, but […] an imaginative and active striving towards what <i>is not yet</i>’.<small><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></small> Adorno modifies Bloch’s concept with an understanding of the pervasiveness of the culture industry: as he writes in <i>Philosophy of New Music</i>, ‘[n]o artist is able on his own to transcend the contradiction between unchained art and enchained society’.<small><a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></small> All they can do, ‘perhaps on the verge of despair, is contradict the enchained society through unchained art’.<small><a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></small> Through its autonomy art is unlike society, intimating and therefore hoping for the possibility of something other than our current situation. As Adorno explains in ‘Commitment’, ‘[e]ven in the most sublimated work of art there is a hidden “it should be otherwise”’, for artworks ‘point to a practice from which they abstain: the creation of a just life’.<small><a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></small> For Adorno such a conception would be, within the absolutely pervasive totality of capitalism<i>, </i>unspeakable and even unthinkable: utopia can be conveyed only in its negative form, in the distance apparent between unchained art and enchained society. It’s for this reason that the radical autonomy of art, preserved only when art is treated as art and not as a medium for philosophy, is so essential: ‘it is to works of art that has fallen the burden of wordlessly asserting what is barred to politics’.<small><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></small><br>
