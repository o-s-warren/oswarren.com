		  Christina Quarles and Illegible Figuration
		</h3>
		
		
		<br><br>
		<div class="para">
		  <p><i>What does it mean to make oneself legible? Much of Christina Quarles’s recent work is concerned with the body, and the ways in which semblances of stability are constituted and dispersed. Quarles makes paintings, richly detailed in experiential liveliness, but with no interest in portraiture, and in fact with little attention given to the body’s visual aspect at all. Rather, these paintings aim to depict embodiment itself: the universal but infinitely varied lived experience of inhabiting a body, something which is far from straightforward.</i></p>
		
		  <br>
		  
		<p>In a 2006 interview with Jörg Heiser, Maria Lassnig argued against art history by insisting that the body was ‘more or less the most difficult subject to paint,’ as ’something you don’t actually see.’ This wisdom is perhaps especially difficult to countenance today, and deliberately so; part of the way in which capital co-opts social movements is through adjusting and diversifying the body’s ongoing commodification, a perverse process played out almost entirely in the visual realm. That the struggle for mainstream representation can be impersonated by capital doesn’t do away with its necessity: although double-edged, significantly increased visibility for marginalised groups is crucial in doing away with the violence of the imaginary ’normal’ body, and any pushback against this is difficult to uncouple from the most reactionary of aesthetics. That particular bodies sell, at the same time as images and ideals of particular bodies are sold to the consumer, is obviously nothing new. That a particularly cynical variant of this mechanism, aligning corporations with social justice in order to deflect criticism, is endemic in today’s media landscape, however, can’t help but shape the consumable status of ‘the body’ in contemporary culture.</p>

		  <p>Resisting such digestibility, Christina Quarles’s depictions of bodies hinge on the coexistence of figurative affect with the equally expressive estrangements of self-consciously painterly gesture. In her 2018 work <i>Sun Bleached</i>, for example, a checkered red-and-white picnic blanket floats suspended against the clear summer sky. Emerging out of it, as if breaking the surface of water, a figure reaches across the picture’s top right corner to run their fingers through the hair of a second person. Both figures’ eyes are cast downward; one is rendered in pencil on raw canvas, the other made up of amorphous and dripping washes of coral and pastel blue. Hunched into the piece’s cramped bottom-left corner are what appear to be two more characters: one is hairless and clutching their guts, the other leans back with a flash of butter-yellow hair. The white sun looks cold in the sky. All this, however, seems only partially relevant to the experience of the painting itself. Quarles often begins a piece by sketching out remembered body parts drawn from years of life-drawing classes, and it’s only relatively late in the picture’s development that these are connected or left disconnected. Actually, much of that work is left to the viewers’ unconscious, happening in the gallery long after the painting is finished: pareidolia, the tendency for people to perceive recognisable patterns in random or vague visual stimuli (think animals in clouds and faces in rocks) is one of the key mechanisms in Quarles’s work. To look at a piece like <i>Sun Bleached</i> is to stage the dysfunctional work of moving from seeing to comprehending, from inscrutability to palatability.

		  <p>What strikes you first is colour and texture; contrast is brought out between bisecting and sharply delineated planes of pigment and pattern, but also through varied vocabularies of painting across the canvas and even within individual figures. Whilst registering this these figures begin to distinguish themselves, at least to the extent that they are distinguished. It’s the hands that Quarles most attends to, the most concrete and expressive points in her paintings, for our hands are the parts of our bodies that we have the most thoroughly unmediated relationship with. Our faces, conversely, are known to us through images and reflections both literal and metaphorical, and therefore faces belong properly to the realm of the social; accordingly, the faces in these pieces are ambiguous and fleeting. The relations between the figures that the hands begin to suggest in their gripping and grasping is not so much a social relation but an intimate one, gesturing more towards the moments of communicating within complication and fragmentation, possible only outside social injunctions for legibility. In an interview with <i>Autre Magazine</i>, Quarles described her annoyance when her work ‘is framed as being overtly sexual,’ and the bodily intimacies evoked in her work encompass modes of being with others and with oneself in which contradiction is inescapable: Quarles is keen to stress the presence of not only sex in her canvasses but violence, and hunger, and sickness. Take <i>Casually Cruel</i> (2018): here, interpersonal contortion and self-mutilation are made literal as two figures violently attempt to come together across a laser-cut stencil mesh all lurid green and blue. One particularly egregious review argues that Quarles ‘takes sex out of the bedroom,’ where it ‘struts its stuff’ on ‘the table of public discussion’; such leering takes manages somehow to miss, spectacularly, the resolute inscrutability of the figures populating the canvas. Even if these bodies present themselves at all, and I’d argue it’s only through a misguided attempt to squarely situate them within the lineage of figurative painting that one could believe they do, they certainly don’t present themselves for our consumption, discursive or otherwise. As Quarles herself puts it: ‘my worst-case scenario is that somebody is able to passively consume an image of a queer body, or of a female body.’</p>

		  <p>As a queer woman born to a black father and a white mother, often assumed to be white (and especially by white people), Quarles’s lived experience of a multiply-situated identity and its attendant ambiguities informs her critique of a firmly demarcated self. Such a self is imagined particularly through social discourse: ‘language falls short of describing my identity and my daily interactions,’ Quarles said in an interview with <i>TANK Magazine</i>, since ’to some degree everyone feels as though their sense of self doesn’t quite line up with how they are perceived by others.’ It’s in attempting to record the deficiencies of assuming a straightforwardly fixed subjectivity that these paintings tap into the mechanisms of non-figurative painting developed over the course of the twentieth century. Figurative painting is experiencing a contemporary revival, as per usual, against a background of oft-assumed irrelevance (alongside an incessant procession of re-emergences throughout the latter half of the twentieth century). Much of the curatorial impetus behind current and recent shows is in re-engaging previous returns to figuration with an expanded politics of representation. <i>Radical Figures</i> at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, where the three Quarles pieces referenced here were exhibited most recently, and <i>New Images of Man</i> at Blum & Poe in Los Angeles both began as dialogues with earlier pivotal exhibitions, critiquing the glaring blind spots arising from their overtly discriminatory curatorial practices. The 1981 <i>New Spirit of Painting</i> exhibition at the Royal Academy with which <i>Radical Figures</i> engages with (and partially recreates in an adjoining space, as <i>New Images of Man</i> does for the 1959 MoMA exhibition from which it takes its title) notoriously featured 38 male painters and no female painters, while Elizabeth Murray and Maria Lassnig were consistently ignored by their male contemporaries within the Neo-expressionist movement. Quarles, though, draws less on these figurative traditions than various modes of abstraction; touchstones include Arshile Gorky and Helen Frankenthaler, their styles reoriented towards the forming and dismantling of a self’s edges through context and contact. In the process of interrogating the boundaries of the body, Quarles draws from the vocabulary of mid-century painterly genres which complicate visual sense-perception; arriving at biomorphic abstraction through Critical Race Theory and Queer Theory reinvigorates these modes with a contemporary urgency. This accumulation of style is deployed with exuberance, with not only each canvas but each figure containing a multitude of contradictions both thematic and formal.

		  <p>There is grief here too, though. In a recent work from 2019, <i>For Whom Tha Sunsets Free</i>, the inhabitants cower and cover their faces as they press close to one another, a jumble of strained sinews. A tilted view of a landscape mocks with its juxtaposition of sunset clouds in a sharply two-dimensional space; here, as elsewhere, geographical and spacial effects serve not to situate but to compress and dislocate. Death is suggested, a pair of legs splayed across the floor. In foregrounding the fragmentary multiplicity of a pre-social self, Quarles is not afraid to depict the trials of that unhappy awareness. Ambiguity and illegibility is honest, but it’s intolerable too; a tension well known by anyone inhabiting a multiply situated identity. Yet within the confines of this extreme hostility, this mutual excess of partialities, the figures find each other. Although making legible often commits a kind of violence in its imprecision, the sheltering banner of a label can be essential in creating spaces of understanding and the platform from which to fight back against a world unjustly configured. Quarles’s work reveals the tenuous links we make and remake towards our senses of selves, and the tribulations of communicating that fragmentary and contradictory self to others, but these canvases are also about the potential for genuine and profound touch. Figures may be constrained, but they are rarely isolated; alliances and allegiances are formed between these dripping subjectivities. Without denying their own multiplicity, inarticulate connections are constituted in communal contradictions; touch as temporary definition for the fluid edges of the ever-shifting self, a provisional communication gesturing to future forms of being together. In a moment when touch and its absence weighs upon us so resolutely, the abstracted figurations of Christina Quarles won’t pretend to offer an idealised togetherness, but they can comfort nonetheless.</p>
