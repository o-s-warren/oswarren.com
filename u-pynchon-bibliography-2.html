		Situating itself within a contemporary reappraisal of Ann Quin's work after the posthumous publication of <i>The Unmapped Country: Stories and Fragments</i> in early 2018, this dissertation aims to situate Quin and her work within a context of British experimental writing of the 1960s. Very little has been written on Quin within academic circles: in light of this, I aim to provide a close reading that attends to the particular difficulties of Quin's published work, difficulties I contend have been elided by the popular revival currently underway. Arguing that such an elision does a great disservice to the complexity of these texts, the final chapter of the dissertation draws out the ways in which a reading of Quin's works, attentively attuned to their contradictions and challenges, reveals prescient resonances with contemporary questions of gender. In demonstrating the way in which Quin's work anticipates later theoretical scholarship and present-day socio-political concerns, this dissertation hopes to reinforce the renaissance of interest in Quin's work, and extend it to a more widespread scholarly engagement.
